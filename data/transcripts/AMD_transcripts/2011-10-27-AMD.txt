Presentation
Operator    [1]

           Good afternoon.  My name is Huey and I will be your conference operator for today.  At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to AMD's third-quarter 2011 earnings conference call.  (Operator Instructions).  As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today.
 I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms.  Ruth Cotter, Vice President of Investor Relations for AMD.  Please go ahead. 

Ruth Cotter,  Advanced Micro Devices - VP IR    [2]

           Thank you and welcome to AMD's third-quarter earnings conference call.
 By now, you should have had the opportunity to review a copy of our earnings release and CFO commentary.  If you have not reviewed these documents, they can be found on AMD's website at quarterlyearnings.AMD.com.
 Participants on today's conference call are Rory Read, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Thomas Seifert, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
 This is a live call and will be replayed via webcast on AMD.com.  There will also be a telephone replay.  The number is 888-266-2081.  Outside of the United States, the number is 703-925-2533.  The access code for both is 155-4016.  The telephone replay will be available for the next 10 days, starting later this evening.
 I'd like to take this opportunity to highlight a few dates for you.  Thomas Seifert will present at the Barclays Global Technology Conference on December 7 in San Francisco.  Rory Read will present at the Raymond James annual IT supply-chain investor conference on December 13 in New York.  Additionally, our 2011 financial analyst day has been deferred to February 2, 2012.  And lastly, our fourth quarter quiet time will begin at the close of business on Friday, December 16, and we'll announce our fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday, January 19, 2012 (corrected by the Company after the call).
 AMD's ownership of GLOBALFOUNDRIES on a fully-diluted basis decreased to approximately 9.6% as of the conclusion of the third quarter.  The two-year time period after which we no longer have the right to designate a representative to the GLOBALFOUNDRIES Board of Directors was triggered in September of this year, when our ownership interest in GLOBALFOUNDRIES decreased below 10% on a fully-diluted basis.
 Reconciliation for all non-GAAP financial measures discussed today is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings release, available in the investor relations section of AMD.com.
 Before we begin today's call, I'd like to caution everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements about management's expectations.  Investors are cautioned that those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions, and expectations; speak only as of the current date; and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.  The semiconductor industry is generally volatile and market conditions are particularly difficult to forecast.
 We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC where we discuss the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations.  You'll find detailed discussions about such risk factors in our most recent SEC filing, AMD's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 2, 2011.
 Now with that, I'd like to hand the call over to Rory.  Rory? 

Rory Read,  Advanced Micro Devices - CEO, President    [3]

           Thank you, Ruth, and thank you all for joining us on the call today.
 AMD's third-quarter revenue was $1.69 billion, up 7% from the prior quarter and up 4% year over year.  And AMD's non-GAAP operating income grew by 28% quarter to quarter and was flat year over year.
 In my first 60 days at AMD, I'm excited by the energy and resources I see here and I am encouraged by what I hear from our customers and partners.  AMD clearly continues to play an important leadership role in the industry, but there is more to do.  There is a lot of interest in our products, and customers are looking for us to improve our execution in order to help them grow even faster.
 Third-quarter demand for our new AMD platforms was strong, particularly in the mobile processor space where we saw revenue grow 35% sequentially and 20% year over year, clearly outpacing the market in a significant way.
 Additionally in the server space, we saw a solid 27% gain in revenues sequentially with solid customer demand for our next-generation Opteron offerings.
 However, we also had our challenges.  We saw both 32 nm and 45 nm supply challenges in the third quarter.  No doubt we must improve our execution, and we are taking action to improve our ability to consistently deliver our products on time, day in and day out.  We are working with our key partners to improve the processes, disciplined to deliver on our commitments to our customers.  We have more to do, but we are clearly making progress and we are on the right path.
 Now let's take a deeper look at the mobile segment.  In the third quarter, we saw record AMD processor shipments and revenue in the mobile space.  Over 90% of our mobile units were Fusion APUs, which are uniquely suited to meet the advanced processing needs of today's mainstream and entry-level mobile PC buyers.
 For example, we believe AMD's worldwide share of the $200 to $600 retail price band is now over 28%.  These bands make up 45% of the retail notebook volume across the planet, and we believe AMD gained consumer notebook share in the key emerging markets year over year, particularly in China where our microprocessor revenue grew 23% quarter on quarter.
 We also set another record for Brazos shipments in the quarter, up 36% quarter to quarter.  And our mobile AMD processor unit sales in total are now up over 50% in the last two quarters alone.  We clearly outgrew the market in the mobile segment and we believe we took share in the quarter.
 Now for our server business.  The third quarter was the beginning of a move in the right direction, with server revenue up 27% sequentially.  Initial production shipments of our new AMD Opteron products gained traction in the high-performance computing space where, with the help of our key partner, Cray, and some of our most notable customers, which included the National Supercomputer Centers in Stuttgart, Germany, in the UK, and in Switzerland, as well as the United States Department of Energy's Titan Project at the Oak Ridge National Laboratories.  This project, in fact, is likely to be one of the world's fastest supercomputers.
 We are excited about our key partners, including HP and Dell, who are launching new products based on our new Opteron platform this fourth quarter, and we are confident they will do well against competition, particularly in key workload areas like the cloud and virtualization.
 Now let's turn our attention to the graphics business.  AMD's graphics segment continued to be a solid business for us.  Segment revenue was up 10% quarter over quarter and up 4% year over year.  This growth was driven largely by strong seasonal revenue increases in the AIB channel.  Our AMD Radeon HD GPU was also recognized as the world's fastest mobile product in the most recent quarter.  This continues to show outstanding graphics innovation from AMD.
 We also publicly demonstrated our next-generation 28 nm GPU product during the third quarter.  And we look forward to building on our performance leadership position in the graphics area throughout 2012 and the years ahead.
 Now let me take a moment to focus on execution.  From an execution standpoint, you know and we know we faced significant manufacturing challenges in the quarter.  Having said that, demand was strong and interest in our products is significant.  We will continue an aggressive effort with our foundry partner to improve manufacturing performance at this important 32 nm technology.  And we are already seeing steady improvement day after day, week after week, but we are not out of the woods yet.
 In the last few quarters, you've also heard Thomas describe our initiatives to streamline our business processes.  We will continue to explore ways to accelerate these efforts, both to unlock these efficiencies and productivity to better compete in the current marketplace, and also to enable our organization to better capture the trends for which our technologies are so well suited, namely the move to low-power platforms, the continued rise of the emerging markets, and the emergence of cloud and mega-datacenter computing.
 So in summary, our exciting new AMD Fusion architecture is a unique and differentiated approach, and we are seeing strong interest from the marketplace.  It is particularly well targeted to lower-power form factors and high-volume price bands.  And our new Opteron server technology is well tuned to increasingly important workloads like virtualization and cloud-based servers.  We are seeing a nice uptick in our server business, which is in fact long overdue.
 Customer demand is strong and momentum is clearly there.  And while we face challenges in supply and execution, we are making steady improvements with a maniacal focus on execution across the entire Company.
 In short, I believe AMD is uniquely positioned to take advantage of today's largest and fastest-growing market opportunities.  Through better execution, we will accelerate our growth.  Through innovation, we will lead in this changing technology landscape and capture the merging inflection points already underway.
 With that, I'll turn it over to Thomas, who will cover the financials for our third quarter. 

Thomas Seifert,  Advanced Micro Devices - CFO    [4]

           Thank you, Rory.
 Revenue in the third quarter was $1.69 billion, up 7% compared to the second quarter of 2011.  Revenue growth in the third quarter of 2011 was adversely impacted by 32 nm and 45 nm product supply constraints.
 The sequential revenue increase was driven primarily by record mobile processor revenue and unit shipments, partially offset by lower desktop revenue due to lower 45 nm supply and seasonally-higher graphics segment revenue.  In addition, since our preliminary third-quarter results announcement in September, we saw unanticipated sales strength in the channel through the end of the quarter.
 Gross margin was 45%, down one percentage point quarter over quarter due to lower-than-expected supply of 45 nm products, lower-than-expected supply of higher-ASP and higher-margin 32 nm products, and therefore a higher percentage of revenue in our lower-margin GPU business.
 Operating expenses were $610 million, less than guided due to lower-than-expected revenue in the quarter and ongoing discipline in expense management.  R&D was $361 million and SG&A was $249 million.  Non-GAAP operating income was $146 million and non-GAAP net income was $110 million.
 Interest expenses declined by $5 million compared to the prior quarter.  Additionally, we repurchased $150 million of our 6% convertible notes in the quarter, which will result in over $2 million of quarterly interest savings moving forward.
 Non-GAAP EPS was $0.15, calculated using the 741 million fully-diluted shares.  Adjusted EBITDA was $239 million, up $34 million from the prior quarter, due to higher operating income driven by higher revenue.
 Now switching to the business segments.  Computing solutions segment revenue was $1.3 billion, up 6% sequentially, driven by record mobile processor revenue and unit shipments, partially offset by lower desktop revenue and double-digit growth in server processor revenue, driven by a significantly higher ASPs.
 Computing solutions operating income was $149 million, up $7 million from the previous quarter, primarily due to a higher mix of APUs and improved server microprocessor ASPs.
 Graphics segment revenue was $403 million, up 10% compared to the prior quarter, mainly due to seasonal strength in the ad import market, strong demand for mobile discrete graphics at OEMs, and an improved product mix.  Graphics segment operating income was $12 million, up $19 million from the prior quarter primarily due to higher GPU shipments and ASP.
 Now let's turn to the balance sheet.  Our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable security balance, including long term, at the end of the quarter was $1.86 billion, down $4 million compared to the end of the second quarter of 2011.
 Accounts receivable at the end of the quarter was $908 million, up $149 million compared to the end of the second quarter due to higher revenue and the timing of sales.  Inventory was $540 million exiting the quarter, down $102 million from the prior quarter due to a decline in 45 nm inventories, driven by the transition to 32 nm products and efficiencies in the back-end manufacturing.
 Long-term debt as of the end of the quarter was $2.1 billion and non-GAAP free cash flow was $131 million.
 Now turning to the outlook, AMD expects revenue to increase 3%, plus or minus 2%, sequentially for the fourth quarter of 2011, and operating expenses are expected to be approximately $620 million.
 APU traction in the marketplace and demand for AMD's leading-edge technology is strong, and while we exit the quarter recognizing we could have done better, we continue to deliver our business model, improving profitability and free cash flow, and we fully expect our strategy to be successful in deliver improving shareholder value going forward.
 With that, I'll turn it back to Ruth.

           Thank you, Thomas.  Operator, we'd be happy for you to poll the audience, please, for the Q&A session.



Questions and Answers
Operator    [1]

     (Operator Instructions).  Glen Yeung, Citigroup. 

Glen Yeung,  Citigroup - Analyst    [2]

     Thank you.  My first question is about gross margins.  Thomas, in your comments, you indicated ASPs were up, it sounds like, quite noticeably in the quarter, and obviously gross margin is impacted by yields.  But how should we think about the recovery of gross margin as yields improve, particularly given the ASP trends you have, and then, specifically, how should we think about gross margins for Q4? 

Thomas Seifert,  Advanced Micro Devices - CFO    [3]

     Thank you, Glen.  Very good questions.
 As we said there in the script, in the third quarter we had to fight a couple of headwinds, mainly on 32 nm supply impacting really the product mix we had in terms of high ASP and highly margin-accretive 32 nm product.  And we also had to make some trade-off decisions on 45 nm capacity that hit us from a cost of goods sold perspective.  And then, we had to deal with a higher relative share of graphic product in the overall revenue picture.
 So how is that going to change moving forward?  So, a couple of trends you have to keep in mind, headwinds and tailwinds.  The tailwinds certainly are we will recover gross margin by shipping a higher share of Llano products and we will increase gross margin, of course, by increasing our server revenue.
 We will face some headwinds in the current quarter.  45 nm supply is still going to be not where we want it to be because we continue to trade off capacity toward 32 nm.  We also will see some ramp-up costs from a 28 nm technology perspective, and we will have a one-time effect in the fourth quarter just cleaning up manufacturing startup costs around 32 nm to make sure that WIP is clear, and that alone, that one-time effect, is going to hit us probably with just under 1%.
 So if you add up all the headwinds and tailwinds, we think we're going to be about flat moving into Q4, but continuing to execute our model, if you keep the one-time effects out of the picture. 

Rory Read,  Advanced Micro Devices - CEO, President    [4]

     You know, when you think about it, Glen, from a standpoint -- one of the key drivers that you can see, and we clearly have more work to do, is around execution.
 As I started my first 60 days here at AMD, when I met with customers, partners across the planet, they've told me they're really interested in the product sets that we're creating and the solutions that we're making here at AMD.  And they also want to believe and trust more and make bigger investments to grow with us, but we have to focus not only just on the margin items that Thomas hit, but across execution.
 Improving our execution and improving our supply position has to be one of our top priorities.  And we have much more still to do in that space.
 You heard it in Thomas's comment.  That impacted our margins and our results, and we're not out of the woods yet, but we're making steady and clear progress day after day, week after week.
 And we're working with some really outstanding technical leaders from here at AMD, our partners like GLOBALFOUNDRIES, but also key partners like IBM and PDF, and we're going machine by machine, step by step, to improve that activity and our yields.  That, I think, will help improve, over a longer period of time, our margin performance, and that's really a little bit more background on that item, Glen. 

Glen Yeung,  Citigroup - Analyst    [5]

     Rory, thanks for that.  Maybe just a follow-up question here, so just based on the comments again, it sounds like what fell short must have been desktop.  And I wonder as I think about the execution issue, one, do you sense that there is a longer-term impact from that?  Did you just turn some customers off forever because you screwed it up on the execution side?  And the reason I bring up desktop is I wonder if that's less impactful when it's in desktop than it would have been were it to be seen more in your notebook results, because I think that's where your customers are probably depending on you more. 

Rory Read,  Advanced Micro Devices - CEO, President    [6]

     Well, that's kind of interesting.  I've had the opportunity over the first two months here to really meet with just about every major partner across the planet, and you know, the feedback has been very consistent.  They really believe in this AMD APU kind of strategy based on the Fusion architecture.
 You know, it's not a surprise that we saw revenues increase 35% sequentially based on this strong APU demand in the mobile space.  And think about it -- to date, we've already shipped 20 million Brazos in that area.
 Clearly from being a customer in my past job, it's about building trust, trust in execution, trust in technology.  We have to continue to focus on that.  That is job one from my perspective.  If we execute better, we'll enhance that trust.  I don't think we've irreversibly damaged that trust at this point, but we eroded some of it and we need to make sure that we execute every day to our commitments.
 You know, you're right.  In the desktop space, there's a little less pressure, but we had to choose where we did our manufacturing capacity in order to support our notebook growth and to make sure that we tried to deliver on the commitments that we made to our customers, and they felt some of that pain in the third quarter because we weren't able to execute as cleanly as we would like.
 In the notebook space, we are making progress.  In the desktop space, I think we know how to manufacture in that space; we just need to be able to move more of the wafers in that direction.  So, net net, I don't see it as an irreversible trend.  I believe this is a trend we can build from, but it's all about execution.
 We need to, as a Company, AMD, deliver on our commitments.  It's whether it's our roadmap, our features, our supply.  That's the first lift to creating shareholder value in this market.  Then we can go tackle in parallel how to intercept the very interesting inflection points going on in the industry.  You know, inflection points around low power, around the cloud, around emerging markets, these are real opportunities.
 Sorry, Glen, but I got fired up on that one. 

Glen Yeung,  Citigroup - Analyst    [7]

     Good to hear from you, Rory.  Thanks. 

Operator    [8]

     Ross Seymore, Deutsche Bank. 

Ross Seymore,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [9]

     Hi, guys.  Continuing on the comment -- or on the topic of the gross margin and more specifically the manufacturing problems, can you just give us an idea -- the good die contract that you signed with GLOBALFOUNDRIES in the first half of this year, I just want a little clarity on how the yield issue impacts your gross margin, considering that you did have that agreement going forward. 

Thomas Seifert,  Advanced Micro Devices - CFO    [10]

     Very good question.  Keep in mind, the die buyer agreement we have is an agreement we have on the 32 nm processor.  It's not an agreement we have on the 45 nm process.
 And I think I described it in the last -- the first-quarter conference call pretty much as a downside protection.  And this is how you have to look at it.  When yields fall below a certain level, the downside is protected, and we build it from there.
 On the 45 nm side, it's a different picture.  We pick up the cost for that capacity and pretty much in the old model.  And since we have allocated 45 nm capacity toward 32 nm capacity, we've got some margin impacts there. 

Ross Seymore,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [11]

     Great, and I guess two somewhat housekeeping issues, I guess.  The first one is a little more, I guess, general.  On the flood side of things over in Thailand, any commentary on what you think that would do to impact you?
 And then, the housekeeping one, on the interest expense, are you more or less saying that the $2 million benefit per quarter is what you'll see in the fourth quarter, so that we can just model that down $2 million? 

Thomas Seifert,  Advanced Micro Devices - CFO    [12]

     Yes, start me with the second question first; that's the easier one.  Yes, that is exactly as you described it.  It's a $2 million benefit on a quarterly base moving forward, and that's what you see, then, in the fourth quarter to 100%.
 On the flood, I think the supply chains in the industry have become rather efficient for maybe the wrong reasons, with all the disasters we had to deal with.  So overall, the reaction time finding out where the bottlenecks could be worked out really well and information flow across the supply chain seems to work rather well, too.
 So from this point and perspective, we don't see an impact in the fourth quarter, to be very honest, at least after discussions with our customers.  We'll have to see how this is going to impact the supply chain moving forward into 2012.  It depends on a lot of things, how long the situation is going to continue and then how much damage needs to be repaired.  But short term, not much of an impact. 

Rory Read,  Advanced Micro Devices - CEO, President    [13]

     Ross, I'll add a little bit of color on that.  As I've been meeting with the key partners in the OEM space, their feedback is, well, that's a challenge.  Thomas is just spot on.  Those supply chains are quite resilient.  They're working hard to work around that and make sure the mix is there.
 The feedback and signals that I've gotten from each of the major players is they're looking for us to improve our execution and deliver more product to them.  They see opportunities to continue to deliver and execute, and the flood doesn't appear to be a major factor at this point.  We're going to continue to monitor it, but all indications at this point that this shouldn't be a major impact. 

Operator    [14]

     JoAnne Feeney, Longbow Research. 

JoAnne Feeney,  Longbow Research - Analyst    [15]

     Great.  Thanks.  I was hoping we could get into the Brazos and notebook side of things a little bit more.  You remarked a little bit about the channel strength ticking up towards the end of the quarter and that's why you ended up a little bit higher.  Now, was that due to sort of the value end of the notebook market, perhaps, or was it due to something else entirely? 

Rory Read,  Advanced Micro Devices - CEO, President    [16]

     What we've seen in the notebooks segment, JoAnne, is we've seen strong uptake in the APU demand, whether it's in the Brazos area and low power and more in the entry bands or into the Llano segment where it's a little bit more into the mainstream.
 $200 to $600 retail price bands were -- we believe the worldwide share now is up to 28%.  And since two quarters ago, we're already up 50%.
 So, there is clearly a couple of major factors that are going on in the marketplace, one around consumerization in the PC market and also around convergence and around the cloud.  The APU strategy that we put in place with the Fusion architecture, with the Brazos and Llano chipsets, really takes advantage -- the idea of the CPU and GPU together, and the idea of delivering the graphical, the user experience from the cloud is very well positioned, and customers are clearly reacting to that in the mobile segment in terms of those entry to mainstream price bands.
 I think that's a reflection that we've been listening to the marketplace and we've been reacting to it.  At this point in the third quarter, the APU mix of our total client business is up to 90% of that client mix, and I think that's pretty telling.  We're going to continue to double-down there, focus on building out that APU strategy, continue to drive for low power.  These are the trends that the customers in those segments are saying, and we're seeing it across the planet. 

Thomas Seifert,  Advanced Micro Devices - CFO    [17]

     Let me follow up on that, JoAnne, so the description you gave is pretty much correct, so it's retail strength in terms of sellthrough.  It was primarily emerging markets and it was primarily around Brazos APU platforms. 

JoAnne Feeney,  Longbow Research - Analyst    [18]

     Great, thanks, Thomas and Rory.  Can I ask one follow-up, please, about the future of Brazos?  You know, everyone expects that the success of this line will continue.  It's been very appealing.
 We understand that the next generation coming will use more advanced manufacturing, and there are some concerns about the readiness of one of your foundry partners to contribute to production of the next-generation Brazos, Krishna and Wichita, and I'm wondering if you have plans for dealing with those challenges your foundry partner may be facing and whether you still think you'll be able to follow the same time zone for releasing the new Brazos at the beginning of the year like you did last year.  Do you think you need a new revision to capture the same interest in the market?  And what's your strategy there? 

Thomas Seifert,  Advanced Micro Devices - CFO    [19]

     So let me get started here.  So I don't want to give any specific statements on roadmap and launch date for 2012, but I think in general terms, of course we are pleased with the success of the low-power version of our Fusion products, and we're excited by the perspective and the opportunities that it creates for us in the marketplace.
 And I think the first follow-up on that is actually the second-generation of Llano products, Trinity, that is going to launch very early next year and where we pretty much cut the power performance in half.  And of course, we will try for the Brazos and Bobcat based products further down, and have a big focus on that.
 And I think we mentioned it also in our last call that moving forward, we think we've found a way to better balance our risk profile in terms of manufacturing foundry partners, and this also, I think, will help us to better mitigate, you know, the ups and downs that are just part of this business model. 

Rory Read,  Advanced Micro Devices - CEO, President    [20]

     You know, JoAnne, as we look at that segment, clearly that Brazos family, we're going to continue to extend that.
 And as we're tracking execution each week across AMD, we're looking at the design win activities with our key OEMs.  We're looking at the momentum of sellthrough.  And the buy-in around the product continues to show strong interest, strong demand.  They're counting on us to improve these execution items that allows us to move forward.
 And I think what we're seeing with the progress that we're making since late September, it's slow, it's steady, we clearly have much more to do, but there are those signs of clear improvement, that demand and interest in this architecture and solution is spot on.
 And Thomas mentioned the emerging markets.  Think about it.  Both in China, India, we saw very significant growth, and this product set should play very strongly there and continue into 2012. 

JoAnne Feeney,  Longbow Research - Analyst    [21]

     Yes, so it seems like both you and your main competitor are launching products earlier in the year than has been traditionally the case.  Do you see the seasonal pattern for sales really shifting earlier in the year? 

Rory Read,  Advanced Micro Devices - CEO, President    [22]

     I think what we're going to see is -- from our perspective at AMD, the key is understand the customer.
 We're spending just an intense amount of time across our business units to really understand the market data.  Where are the customer pain points?  What's the feedback we're getting from the key retailers?  What is the feedback from the customer sets that are interested in the product?
 And what we're trying to do is take that and combine it with where we believe the puck is going, right?  We want to skate not where it is today, but where it's headed to.
 And if you think about that in this set, I really think that we're building on that same set of success, and what we're trying to do is to continue a nice drumbeat of products throughout the year and to make sure that we're keeping a fresh set of improvements that allows us to improve the experience for that customer.  Customers are telling us low power.  They're talking about faster boot times.  They're talking about a better experience in terms of the graphical representation and the experience on the screen.
 That's what they get with AMD's Fusion architecture and the APU set.  That's why we'll bring it to market as we have those solutions and make sure that we're hitting the customer, and we're going to try to get there first.  We have work to do, but we're going to do that.

Uche Orji,  UBS - Analyst    [24]

     Thank you very much.  Rory, can I just probe a little bit into the strength you saw in the channel post the pre-announcement?  I'm still not sure I'm convinced as to what drove that.  I mean, [is an equal] ask whether that's a case of customers trying to get what they can, given the announced manufacturing problems, or are you convinced it's really end demand?  And if so, what were the real catalysts that drove the further strength in demand soon after the pre-announcement? 

Rory Read,  Advanced Micro Devices - CEO, President    [25]

     You know, what I think, Uche, is -- it's very important.  When we took a look at the data throughout the quarter, it was clear that we were going to miss the original guidance, and there is no doubt that was the case.
 It was our prudent decision that we needed to represent that to our shareholders, to our investors, and to the marketplace.  And that's what we did.
 I think as you looked at it, we had the impact we saw in terms of the margin down one point quarter over quarter and we saw outside of the range of guidance on revenue.  We did see some activity that quite frankly surprised us a little bit in the channel at the very end of the quarter in terms of some sellthrough of some channel inventory that was a little bit higher.  But there's no doubt that was the prudent decision, given we were going to miss the guidance that we had shared.
 And think about it.  Take a look at our inventory position.  Our inventory position hasn't been in a better position in a long time, and that's a reflection of a maniacal focus on improving productivity, but also we've got that bit of surge of channel sellthrough at the very end that kind of pushed us a little bit higher on that.  But in no way you look at it, that was the right call, the prudent decision. 

Uche Orji,  UBS - Analyst    [26]

     That is clear.  Thanks for that.  Could I have a quick follow-up?  In terms of really what happened with the cycle time and the yield issues, how better controlled is that now, and specifically what lessons have you learned with it that you think can apply to Trinity?  And from the early signals you're seeing with Trinity, are you comfortable with where you think that yield could be within a few months of launch?  And also, the same question would apply to Bulldozer.  Just kind of get a sense of what you learned from this and how we should be able to feel comfortable when you give us the guidance around Trinity in the future. 

Rory Read,  Advanced Micro Devices - CEO, President    [27]

     Sure.  From a standpoint, clearly we were disappointed with the execution around the yields in the 32 nm space, and that occurred over sustained periods of time, and as I mentioned in my comments in earlier questions, we are not out of the woods yet.
 We're making progress and we're focused on it every single day, and we're seeing progress, but again we are focused at a machine-by-machine level, step by step, and trying to improve both our sort yields, our total yields across the board.
 This is something -- based on some strong results here from your perspective, you might get the wrong read on this.  We have work to do in the execution space, and while we're making progress, we need to continue that progress.  I think we're seeing that steady improvement, and step by step, machine by machine, we'll make that progress in 32.
 And clearly, we will ship significantly more 32 nm product in fourth quarter than we did in third quarter.  And then, what we're doing is to apply the learnings to 28 nm.  The difference between 32 nm and 28 nm, quite frankly, isn't gigantic.  And the experiences that we're learning there in terms of the machine-level data, the flow through the recipe, those we're applying in the 28 nm space.
 Again, we have much more work to do, but we believe that we're making steady progress day after day.  We have more work to do, but we're on it, and this is really job one from my perspective.  We must execute better as a Company.  My experience as a customer of AMD for five years, this is an area that we must improve on, whether it's on the road map, features, or supply.  Our customers have been telling me that the first 60 days, every single day, and we cannot let them down.
 We need to improve.  Not out of the woods yet, making progress, and 28 nm very close to 32 nm.  We're taking the learnings and applying them. 

Uche Orji,  UBS - Analyst    [28]

     Thank you very much.  Good luck.

     Cody Acree, Williams Financial. 

Cody Acree,  Williams Financial Group - Analyst    [30]

     Hi, guys, thanks a lot for taking the questions.  Maybe for both Rory and Thomas.  I guess, given that this goes back to the July conference call, I'd like to get maybe a bit of quantification on where you started with the yield curve as you were coming into that July call that gave you confidence of a 10% growth.  What happened to the yield trajectory?  To what degree of quantification can you give that?  You talked about execution, but I think we need some degree of what exactly the progress has been and what kind of ramp are you on for the next few months. 

Thomas Seifert,  Advanced Micro Devices - CFO    [31]

     Yes, I think let me try to give you some color around that.  And of course, you will understand that we will not disclose specific yield figures.
 But going into the quarter, we were, based on the information we had and the data we looked at, pretty confident that we could outperform the ramp of the Brazos product line.  And if we look back today, then we did not really achieve that.  We are pretty much on the same slope, but we could not outperform our -- that slope as we had previously expected.
 It's not so much only a matter of here's a product issue and we have product yield issue, it was really -- it was much more a matter of how do you get a significant and very steep capacity ramp handled at our foundry partner?  A lot of new tools had to be brought on place, had to be ramped, had to be qualified, and how disciplined and how successful this steep ramp-up process was handled gave us a lot of headache over the quarter and a lot of volatility.  So not so much only in terms of did we lose product on the wafer, but just not getting enough wafers out the door, so to speak. 

Cody Acree,  Williams Financial Group - Analyst    [32]

     And Thomas, I guess if we look at where that yield curve is today versus where you expected it to be, is it a matter of just, I guess, a push-out of that same type of ramp or is it a reduction in that ramp so that you hit the endpoint further out rather than just maybe a gap of the correction being put in place? 

Thomas Seifert,  Advanced Micro Devices - CFO    [33]

     I would say it's a matter of both, to be very honest, but at least the volume we lost from [it] as pure volume and capacity bring in place perspective that will be recovered without any doubt and without any gap.  Once you have a little delay on your yield curve, on the product yield curve, that's obviously leads to a time delay, but we saw steady improvement.  You heard Rory talking about that we will see significantly more output in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter.  So we see the trend being reversed, but we also have some work that still needs to be done. 

Rory Read,  Advanced Micro Devices - CEO, President    [34]

     And Cody, from a standpoint of that curve, we're not where we want to be yet.  That is the bottom line.  We have more work to do on it.
 We had to shift volume away from 45 nm and away from desktop in order to get the yield and to try and fulfill as much of the customer demand as we possibly could.  While that's -- we're seeing some improvements, we're still not at the right levels and we need to make more progress.
 And I think what we're doing with -- I think what we've done with our key partner there, I've spent a lot of time with their executive team and they're bought in just as significantly at GLOBALFOUNDRIES as AMD to work with us and to find the right path here, and then bringing up the other key partners, like IBM and PDF as I suggested earlier.  These things are the things that will help to lift that on a sustainable basis.
 Again, we are not where we need to be yet and we have to make choices to get the best outcome to satisfy as many of our customers as possible, but we have more work to do, Cody. 

Cody Acree,  Williams Financial Group - Analyst    [35]

     And I guess, if you can -- maybe just a comment on the health of the overall PC market.  I guess not your share gains outstanding or the current manufacturing constraints, can you kind of talk about what the backdrop is versus where you would expect it to be seasonally? 

Rory Read,  Advanced Micro Devices - CEO, President    [36]

     Well, you know, as I look at it, I look at some of the same data you look at, whether you go look at IDC or any of the other industry reports out there.
 I believe the PC market is going to continue to grow, and it's going to grow for the foreseeable future.  I think there is going to be hundreds of millions of new PC customers over the coming years, and I think there are going to be a lot of them in the emerging market, and that's why I'm so pleased with the progress that we're beginning to see in our emerging-market focus.  And we're doing to double-down in that space.  We need to continue to build momentum in the emerging markets.  We know that a lot of that growth, a huge portion, is going to come in those entry and mainstream price points.
 This is right smack where we can reach with the Brazos and Llano technologies.  That APU has a value proposition that works, and you look at the combination, emerging market, right technology, even as it moves to more cloud delivery of content, you're going to see the importance of the APU and the GPU built into that APU become even more critical.
 So I believe that the market -- the PC market as represented by IDC is a fair representation.  There will be growth and it will continue to grow and it will continue to grow consistently over the next several years.
 Now, if there's some huge macroeconomic event, I can't predict that, but clearly the market, I believe, is solid.  It's growing and it has opportunities for us, particularly with the products and technology sets we have. 

Cody Acree,  Williams Financial Group - Analyst    [37]

     Rory, lastly, I know it's early, but I'd like to get your thoughts on AMD's eventual participation in the tablet market and maybe eventually into even the smartphone market.  I guess what are your initial thoughts on pulling your architecture down into those lower power envelopes or is it something that you would consider moving to bring in an encore for that usage? 

Rory Read,  Advanced Micro Devices - CEO, President    [38]

     I think it's a fair question, but remember, I'm here 60 days.  We'll have an analyst in February, but I think you're on a right trend here in the idea that low power is a trend that is here to stay.
 You know, thin and light, convergence, consumerization, those are core trends.  They're not going to change.
 We're listening to the customer.  We want to focus on what that customer needs, how we can create leadership, and then drive that through.  You're going to see us, as I mentioned, double-down in those key areas around low power.  That is a trend -- Thomas mentioned next year and the kind of power envelope reductions that we're driving in the Brazos and Llano family.  You think about the work that we'll do across the APU and how to continue to extend that architecture and the Fusion architecture so that that customer experience is even better.  Low power is definitely a right trend.
 I also think the trends in the emerging market, where I think low power, thin, light, a bit longer battery life, those are trends that are going to play.  Customers like them.  They're going to want them and they want them in a value proposition that works.  I can promise you that we're going to look at the market data and make sure that we're understanding and fill the areas that give us the return and the benefit that leverage the capability across AMD.
 And you think about it, across 60 days, I have been very impressed with the technical capabilities of AMD.  We just announced Mark Papermaster joining our team as the Senior Vice President of Technology and Engineering, our CTO.  He comes from a background of some of the most innovative companies in the industry.  I think that -- a teammate like that coming on board and is focused in this segment, there are a lot of very importance of inflection points.
 You talk about tablet.  I'm not sure that tablet, just in the form factor itself, is the real game at hand.  I think the impact in terms of proprietary control points and shifts in the marketplace that's going to occur both in client/server over the coming months and years are going to be exciting opportunities.  And for us at AMD with the capability we have to first focus on execution, execution, execution; deliver on our commitments; then focus on innovation.
 Where is the puck going?  In those areas, get the right technical team.  We have thousands of engineers that we've created the capability to tackle this.  How many companies have that capability?  And the status quo is going to change.  That is an opportunity for us.  We're at a market-share position where the upside is in front of us.  We have to embrace those changes and move forward.
 We'll get a little more detail around the specifics in our February session, but clearly our capabilities, the kind of talent that we have here that we're developing, that we already have, and the talent that we're beginning to attract into the team are the kinds of solutions to react to the marketplace.  And you're right.  Low power is right, emerging market is right, and that trend is going to continue.

     David Wong, Wells Fargo. 

David Wong,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [40]

     Thank you very much.  Your guidance for growth in December, just a clarification.  Did you say that that will be driven by an increase in output of Llano, so there will actually be a fair increase in revenue from Llano, rather than a shift back to more output on 45 nm? 

Thomas Seifert,  Advanced Micro Devices - CFO    [41]

     So we guided revenue up quarter over quarter with a midpoint of 3%, and we also said that this will include a significant increase of our shipments on 32 nm and Llano.  Yes, that is true. 

David Wong,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [42]

     Okay, great, and when might we hope to see the first product on the power driver core? 

Thomas Seifert,  Advanced Micro Devices - CFO    [43]

     One of the first products we launch will be Trinity, and we have not released an official launch date yet, but it will happen early in the year. 

David Wong,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [44]

     Okay, great, and could you give us a rough idea of how many Llano chips did ship in the September quarter and what you expect in terms of unit shipments in December for Llano? 

Thomas Seifert,  Advanced Micro Devices - CFO    [45]

     No, but I said you can deduct that from what I said before.  Our original intent was to really outperform the Brazos ramp in terms of steepness of the slope, and we were, for the reasons we have discussed now at length, not able to achieve that.  But we are on a similar trajectory than we -- what we had on our Brazos ramp on a quarterly comparable level. 

Ruth Cotter,  Advanced Micro Devices - VP IR    [46]

     Operator, we will take two more questions, please. 

Operator    [47]

     John Pitzer, Credit Suisse. 

John Pitzer,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [48]

     Thanks for squeezing me.  Tom, just a clarification on the negotiations with GLOBALFOUNDRIES around good die versus cost plus.  How long is that agreement in place?  And if it's going to sort of grandfather here, do you have the leverage to go back and continue down a good die kind of contract with your foundry partner GLOBALFOUNDRIES? 

Thomas Seifert,  Advanced Micro Devices - CFO    [49]

     Fair question.  So, the agreement we have in place is around 32 nm, and it's pretty much limited until the end of the current calendar year, and then we would default back to the original agreement.
 I think you also said already on the last call that we have started negotiations with our partners, and they are progressing well, and as soon as we have an update and something to announce, we'll talk about it.  But we are in the process.  As I said, this is a very firm, it's a very committed partnership and it's moving along. 

John Pitzer,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [50]

     And then, Rory, as a follow-up, you mentioned Mark's name earlier.  When you look at his resume, he's very strong in PowerPC, a very rich [arm] history.  Not necessarily a rich x86 history.  So I'm just kind of curious if this is a subtle signaling that perhaps you're moving to a multi-architectural strategy, and if it's not, I guess, what core skill sets does Mark bring to the table that you think are a good fit with the challenges at AMD today? 

Rory Read,  Advanced Micro Devices - CEO, President    [51]

     Sure, no problem, John.  You know, from the standpoint of what I've seen here over the first 60 days, I really have been impressed with the technical capability.  And when you look at the technology industry in this silicon space, there is very few players can match the capability that AMD has in terms of its engineering capacity, the talent that we have on board.
 We have some great leaders and we have a large contingent of just super-talented engineers that are fighting every day to find out what the customer needs and how to tackle it.
 And you know, there was an opportunity to go out and work with Mark, and he saw the same kind of excitement around AMD that I did and, you know, that Thomas has shared over the past several quarters.
 I think the marketplace definitely has some very interesting inflection points.  Whether it is architectural, whether it's form factor-based, there's things that are occurring in the marketplace that will change the status quo, and as I said in an earlier question, I believe that it's key for us to embrace, be the innovative disruptor, to make sure that we continue to build on that.
 We have a long track record in x86 and we're going to continue to build on that.  It just makes sense, and from a standpoint of Mark, what he brings to the table, innovation, leadership.  He knows the market.  He's been a customer.  He knows about architectures, and you combine it with the talent we have in place, with Chekib and the leaders across the engineering teams, this is an opportunity for us not only to leverage our existing businesses, but to see where the puck is getting next.  Where is the next evolution of APUs?  What -- how do we take that further?
 We are on the right track there and the right kind of execution.  How far can we go on power?  How can we leverage these kinds of solutions into server?  We are a design organization, a design company, and we need to take those actions to move the ball forward. 

Operator    [52]

     Hans Mosesmann, Raymond James. 

Hans Mosesmann,  Raymond James & Associates - Analyst    [53]

     Great, thank you.  A couple of questions.  In terms of Q4, what would your sales outlook be if you had unconstrained supply issues -- if you were unconstrained? 

Rory Read,  Advanced Micro Devices - CEO, President    [54]

     We wouldn't comment on that.  That is not a normal idea.  Obviously, it would be higher, but that's about the only thing I'd say about it. 

Hans Mosesmann,  Raymond James & Associates - Analyst    [55]

     Perhaps in terms of the seasonality, would it be seasonal like you commented on your graphics business in Q3? 

Rory Read,  Advanced Micro Devices - CEO, President    [56]

     I think we've given the clear guidance of where we think it's going to settle in.  You can see the IDC kinds of information.  I think we've represented that data and we've shared it clearly. 

Hans Mosesmann,  Raymond James & Associates - Analyst    [57]

     And then, as a follow-up, it looks like your yields are improving, but you really haven't figured out the root cause.  It looks like it's an [iterating] process.  Do you have a Plan B in place or on the table, perhaps using your other foundry to kind of fix the problem, because it seems they have no issues whatsoever with Brazos, and the Llano would be a continuation of that kind of architecture? 

Rory Read,  Advanced Micro Devices - CEO, President    [58]

     I think it's unfair to kind of suggest that we don't have understanding of the root cause.  The analysis that we're doing is machine by machine, step by step.  We're making those changes as we speak and we begin -- we have begun to see over the past several weeks, with this kind of intense maniacal focus on execution, that it starts -- starts of improvements across that set.
 So I don't want to leave anyone with the feeling that we aren't working that, understanding the issue and have our hands on the rudder and driving this boat.  We have work to do, I'll for sure share that, and you know it and I know it.  We have to improve our execution, but we have the experience, the expertise that's getting underneath that that we believe will drive further improvements as you go through the quarter.  Thomas, do you want to add anything (multiple speakers) 

Thomas Seifert,  Advanced Micro Devices - CFO    [59]

     No, I think that is very fair.  I think it's a very important correction to make.  It's not like this is an iterative process where we don't know where we go.  It's a complex situation.  It takes maniacal focus, as Rory said.  We've put lots of teams on this problem from our partner, from our Company, from outside, from the ecosystem, and we work hard in that direction.  We see the improvement.  It is the steep road, but we know the direction and we know the path. 

Hans Mosesmann,  Raymond James & Associates - Analyst    [60]

     Thank you very much for the clarification. 

Ruth Cotter,  Advanced Micro Devices - VP IR    [61]

     Thank you.  Operator, if you would like to conclude the call, please. 

Operator    [62]

     Yes, ma'am.  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation.  This does conclude today's conference.  Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.
