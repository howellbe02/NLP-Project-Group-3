Presentation
Operator    [1]

           Good day and welcome everyone to the Google, Inc.  second-quarter 2011 earnings conference call.  This call is being recorded.  At this time I would like to turn the call over to Jane Penner, Senior Manager Investor Relations.  Please go ahead, ma'am. 

Jane Penner,  Google - Senior Manager IR    [2]

           Good afternoon everyone, and welcome to today's second-quarter 2011 earnings conference call.  With us are Larry Page, Chief Executive Officer; Patrick Pichette, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Susan Wojcicki, Senior Vice President, Advertising; Nikesh Arora, Senior Vice President and Chief Business Officer.
 First, Larry, Patrick, Nikesh and Susan will provide us with their thoughts on the quarter.  Also, as you know, we now distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at investor.google.com.  So please refer to our IR website for our earnings releases, as well as supplementary slides that accompany the call.
 This call is also being webcast from investors.google.com.  A replay of the call will be available on our website in a few hours.
 Now let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor.  Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding Google's future investments, and our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our business, and our expected level of capital expenditures.
 These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.  Please note that these forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation, and we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.
 Please refer to our SEC filings for a more detailed description of the risk factors that may affect our results.
 Please note that certain financial measures that we use on this call, such as operating income and operating margin, are also expressed in a non-GAAP basis -- on a non-GAAP basis, and have been adjusted to exclude charges related to stock-based compensation.
 We have also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capital expenditures, which we refer to as free cash flow.  Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release.
 With that, I will now turn the call over to Larry. 

Larry Page,  Google - CEO    [3]

           Well, thank you.  And good afternoon everyone, thanks for joining us today.  It is really exciting to be on the call today and share directly with you the progress we have made in my first quarter as CEO.
 As you have seen from our press release, we had a great quarter, with revenue up by 32% year on year and a new record for quarterly revenue at over $9 billion.
 We have substantially increased our velocity and execution this quarter, which is a key goal of mine since taking over as CEO.  That is why I created a new product-focused management structure with a clear leader responsible for each area.
 The new management team is working together fabulously, and has already achieved a lot in just these three months.  First of all I wanted to talk about Google+, which we launched a field trial invitation only.
 Our goal with Google+ is to make sharing on the Web like sharing in real life, as well as to improve the overall Google experience.  Circles lets you choose with precision who you're sharing with.  Not surprisingly, this has been very well received, because in real life we share different things with different people.
 Hangouts allows for serendipitous interactions, like in real life when you run into a few friends.  It gives you seamless and fun multiuser video, and it is really amazing.
 Last quarter we launched the +1 button in search results and ads, enabling users to recommend stuff they like and to have those recommendations show up in the search results of people they know.  This quarter we released the +1 buttons to the entire Web.  And many sites like Huffington Post, The Washington Post and Best Buy, have added +1 buttons.
 Google+ is still in field trial with limited access as we scale the system.  Users have to be invited and sign up for the profile in order to use it.  However, the growth on Google+ has been great, and I'm excited to release some new metrics for you today.
 Over 10 million people have joined Google+.  That is a great achievement for the team.  There is also a ton of activity.  We are seeing over 1 billion items shared and received in a single day.
 Our +1 button is already all over the Web.  It is being served 2.3 billion times a day.  So while we still have a lot of work still to do, we are really excited about our progress with Google+.
 Google+ is also a great example of another focus of mine, beautiful products that are simple and intuitive to use, and actually was one of the first products to contain our new visual redesign.  We also launched our beautiful, consistent and simpler design on our homepage, Gmail and Calendar, with many more products soon to come.
 Greater focus has also been another big feature for me this quarter; more wood behind fewer arrows.  Last month we announced that we would the closing Google Health and Google PowerMeter.  We have also done substantial internal work, simplifying and streamlining our product lines.
 While much of that work has not yet become visible externally, I am very happy with our progress here.  Focus and prioritization are crucial, given our amazing opportunities.  Indeed, I see more opportunities for Google today than ever before, because, believe it or not, we are still in the very early stages of what we want to do.
 Even in search, which we have been working on for 12 years, there has never been more important changes to make.  For example, this quarter we launched a pilot that shows an author's name and picture in search results, making it easier for users to find things from authors they trust.
 Of course, when we started doing search people thought we were crazy.  They said there is no money to be made in search over and above a bit of banner advertising.  Most new Internet businesses have had that same criticism.
 Fast-forward to today.  It feels like we are watching the same movie again in slow motion.  We have tremendous new businesses being viewed as crazy.  Android -- and actually have a new metric to report in Android of 550,000 phones activated a day.  That is a huge number, even by Google's standards.
 Chrome is the fastest growing browser.  We have over 160 million users.  Now people rightly ask, how will we monetize these businesses?  Of course, I understand the need to balance the short-term with the longer-term needs, because our revenues and growth serve as the engine that funds our innovation.  But our emerging high usage products can generate huge new businesses for Google in the long run, just like search.  And we have tons of experience monetizing successful products over time.
 Well-run technology businesses with tremendous consumer usage make a lot of money over the long term.  Now I think about our products in three separate categories.  First, there is search and our ads products, the core driver of revenue for the Company.  Nikesh and Susan are going to talk more about ads later in the call.
 Next, we have products that are employing high consumer success -- YouTube, Android and Chrome.  We are investing in these in order to optimize their long-term success.
 Then we have our new products -- Google+ and Commerce and Local.  We are investing in them to drive innovation and adoption.  Overall, we are focused on long-term, absolute profit and growth, as we have always been.  And I will continue the tight financial management we have had in the last two years, even as we are making significant investments in our future.
 I would like to finish on our people.  Great companies are no greater than the efforts and ingenuity of their people.  We are continuing to hire the best.  Keeping them happy and well-rewarded is crucial to our future.  Many of you will be interested in hiring, whether we hired a few hundred more or less than you expected this quarter.  But we will optimize headcount for the long term and the opportunities we see.
 I'm happy with the investments we have made in people, though we are probably even a little ahead of where we need to be with headcount growth at the edge of what is manageable now.  Easy to focus on things that we do that are speculative, e.g., driverless cars.  But we spend the vast majority of our resources on the core products.
 We may have a few small speculative projects happening at any given time, but we are very careful stewards of shareholder money.  We are not betting the farm on this stuff.
 All of us at Google want to create services that people in the world use twice a day, just like a toothbrush.  We strive to make those services beautiful, simple and easy to use.  That way we can provide huge benefit to the world.
 We have made a good start, but we are only at 1% of what is possible.  Google is just getting started, and that is why I am here working hard to lead the Company into the next level.
 Thank you.  And, again, we had a great quarter.  Now over to Patrick for the financial results. 

Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP, CFO    [4]

           Thank you, Larry.  Thank you, everybody.  Thanks for joining us.  And Larry is going to stay with us for the Q&A, so I just wanted to make sure that everybody knows he's not going anywhere.
 Okay, so let's go through the number.  We have, obviously, an excellent quarter, with 32% year-over-year revenue growth in Q2.  And it clearly demonstrated the continuing power of Google's product innovation, but also the relentless momentum of the digital economy.
 The strength continues to be driven by our core desktop search ads, but also increasingly by new emerging areas, just like the mobile display, including YouTube and enterprise, that we regularly talk about.
 So let's turn to the specifics of our performance in the quarter.  Gross revenue grew 32% year-over-year, and we have reached $9 billion in revenue, 5% quarter-over-quarter growth as well.  Note that while currency fluctuation boosted our revenue somewhat, even in constant FX terms our growth rates remain strong, particularly in what tends to be a seasonally slower quarter.
 Google website revenue was up 39% year-over-year to $6.2 billion, and 6% quarter-over-quarter, with strength across most major geographies and verticals.  Google Network revenue was also up 20% year-over-year to $2.5 billion, 2% quarter-over-quarter.
 Network revenue was again negatively impacted by the search quality improvements made during the latter part of Q1, as you'll remember.  And note that Q2 reflects a full quarter of this impact.
 This impact is to be expected in the short term, given that it is now different publishers that are receiving traffic and may not have yet optimized their sites for our advertising programs.
 Other revenue was also up 20% year-over-year to $310 million, and 15% quarter-over-quarter.  Our global aggregate paid click growth was strong, up 18% and down 2% quarter-over-quarter.
 Our UI changes to search ads, such as Visurl, drove year-over-year click growth in Q2, along with the ongoing and accelerating shift from off-line to online.  The slight decline quarter-over-quarter is just typically consistent with our summer seasonality.
 Aggregate cost per click growth was also very healthy, up 12% year-over-year and up 6% quarter-over-quarter.  Note that FX also had a positive impact on CPC.  And remember too that this is an aggregate number that includes both google.com and our AdSense properties.
 Turning to our geographic performance, the US and rest of world are growing both at very good pace, and our results reflect that.  While the UK still continues to lag slightly in the global recovery, year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter growth in Q2 continues to show signs of acceleration in the UK as well.
 So revenue from the US was up 26% year-over-year to $4.2 billion.  And in our earning slides, which you can find on our Investor Relations website, you will see that we have broken down our revenue by US, UK and rest of world to show the impact of FX and the benefits of our hedging program.  So please refer to those slides for the exact calculations.
 Non-US revenue accounted for 54% of our total revenue or $4.9 billion, up 38% year-over-year, which includes only $4 million of benefits from hedging programs compared to last year where we had $79 million of benefits for Q2.
 Year-over-year growth in fixed FX would have been 29% versus the 38% I just mentioned.  Japan's future revenue was, again, negatively impacted by the aftermath of the disaster there, but there again we see signs of faster recovery, faster than expected at first.
 The UK was up 27% year-over-year to $976 million.  And year-over-year growth in fixed FX would still have been a healthy 19% for the UK.
 Let me turn to expenses.  Traffic acquisition costs were $2.1 billion or 24.2% of total advertising revenue.  Our other cost of revenue was $1.1 billion, including stock-based compensation of $51 million.  And finally, our operating expenses, which excludes stock-based compensation, totaled $2.6 billion.  The stock-based compensation totaled $384 million in Q2.
 The increase in year-over-year in OpEx was primarily due to payroll, increased advertising and promotional spend, and also professional services.  So as a result, our non-GAAP operating profit was $3.3 billion in Q2, which exclude the stock-based compensation, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 36.7%.
 Headcount was up approximately 2,450 versus Q1, ending the quarter with 28,768 full-time employees.  When we exclude ITA adds of roughly 450, the net headcount growth is roughly similar to Q1.
 Our effective tax rate was 19% in Q2.  And the effective tax rate is down due to the mix of earnings between domestic and international subsidiaries, as well as our hedges.
 Let me turn now to cash management.  In other income and expense our results were $204 million for Q2.  A solid portfolio management performance from our team, which like every quarter, is offset by the impact of our hedging expenses associated with FAS 133, which it in itself was also significantly lower in Q2, gave us these great results.  For more detail on OI&E, again, please refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR websites.
 Operating cash flow, very strong, $3.5 billion for Q2.  CapEx for the quarter was $917 million versus last quarter of $890 million.  So pretty much in line.
 The majority of our CapEx spend in Q2 was related to facilities expenses and production equipment.  And regarding specifically the facility expenses, like last quarter we just happen to have a great opportunity in Q2 to purchase buildings in Dublin and in Mountain View, and we took that opportunity.
 As a reminder, we will continue to make significant CapEx investments, and these have shown to be lumpy from quarter to quarter, depending on when we are able to actually make these investments.  So, overall, we can be nothing but pleased with our free cash flow, which was $2.6 billion for Q2.
 As Larry mentioned earlier, we continued to deliver growth with a disciplined agenda.  This means investing and making sure that our resources deployed wisely with focus and a balance between that short and long term that Larry covered.
 So with those financial highlights covered, I am going to turn it over to Nikesh, who actually cover now our sales performance in the quarter.  Here you go, Nikesh. 

Nikesh Arora,  Google - SVP, Chief Business Officer    [5]

           Thank you, Patrick.  I am going to give you a quick update on our business activities, which spans sales, partnership, marketing and customer service around the world in support of our product and revenue.
 Let me start by focusing on the first priority for our sales team, the need to continue to drive our revenue growth in core and new businesses.  This quarter we continued to drive revenues in our core areas like search, as well as new areas like display, mobile and enterprise.
 Core search and desktop has done really well this quarter, with google.com accelerating, and our large advertisers continuing to spend more as they see more value in search.
 We have also been able to drive tremendous focus on small advertisers around the world, with programs like GXP, which I will talk about slightly later.
 Totally, however, our sales teams are getting better at tailoring integrated solutions for our clients using the full array of our advertising products.  These solutions create greater opportunities to improve our customer's marketing ROI.
 Clients have used search to focus their targeting capabilities, such as audience and topic targeting, to help improve the marketing effectiveness.  Some of our most successful search clients include people like GM and [Egitear].
 On the other hand, in addition to our core desktop search business, we continue to be very excited about our investments in display and mobile.  Let me first focus on display.
 We have seen continued healthy growth in our display product space across all fronts -- advertiser, publisher and technology solutions.  98 of the top Ad Age 100 advertisers have bought display across YouTube and the Google Display Network this quarter.
 Customers continue to use our DoubleClick products, and we are happy with the increased use of the DoubleClick Ad Exchange and invites media for [AdLine].  With our announcements to acquire AdMeld, we hope to deliver even better solutions to our publishers and buyers.
 Continuing on display on YouTube where we have over 3 billion daily views, we have had great success bringing popular content to our users, further increasing audience engagements.  Take, for example, our April broadcast of the royal wedding, which generated 100 million YouTube views.
 Our range of platform and content means that advertisers are beginning to use them for superior branding solutions.  A great example of our branding products in action was T-Mobile's launch of the Samsung S4G on YouTube.  In this campaign T-Mobile took over YouTube running ads on the home page, watch page, mobiles.  That particular campaign helped them reach 46 million unique users.
 Continuing to talk about revenues, our mobile business continues to be another area of robust growth.  The number which Larry has shared of 550,000 Androids, that and the success of smartphones in general mobility devices around the world, is acting as an accelerator to our mobile advertising efforts.
 Let me just take one quick example.  One format, which was launched by Susan's team, called Click-to-Call, or Click-to-Share, has been particularly successful.  (inaudible) is a great use case of these formats.  They integrated our ad mall product into a very large campaign to launch a new product.  They used a banner to drive traffic to a campaign mobile site and achieved unprecedented results, with almost 700,000 unique visitors accessing their content.
 Another leg of our revenues is the Enterprise business.  We have seen great results in Enterprise as well.  In particular, apps for business continues to grow as organizations move to the cloud.  We have had key wins with InterContinental Hotels, [Demova], the state of Wyoming.  In addition to that some small simple changes in our product site have allowed us to tremendously accelerate Google Apps for small businesses.
 Looking at our revenues from a slightly different perspective, geographies and customer segments, we have seen strong growth in regions and across customers of all sizes.  First, let's take a look at geographies.  We maintained our strength in large, mature countries, while we accelerated in emerging ones.
 In our large, mature countries even though some are facing economic challenges, the secular trend of online advertising and the effectiveness of the teams to continue to drive healthy revenue growth is showing great results.
 Several countries are worth noting, as Patrick mentioned.  The UK has accelerated this quarter with strong growth by small advertisers.  In Japan we have seen recovery driven primarily by display and mobile spending by large advertisers.
 Our focused execution in Canada and Spain has led to these markets beginning to show recovery.  Finally, we saw tremendous growth in emerging countries, especially Brazil and Russia, where our display products are getting strong adoption from advertisers.
 Across each country we focused on improving the product knowledge and selling capability of our salesforce.  Our front-line teams can now sell search, display and mobile to the needs of our customers, which is a great trend we are seeing of integrated products selling across multiple mobile ad formats.
 As a result, we are becoming better advisors to the digital space for our large advertisers.  For example, Nike, Sony Ericsson, Telefonica, all of them partnered with us to create integrated solutions around their sponsorship of [Corporate] America.
 Outside of revenue, one key area of responsibility is marketing.  We continue to use marketing as a strategic lever.  We use marketing to booster our customer acquisitions, as well as usage of our key consumer products.
 I am very proud of my team's work on Get Businesses Online, GXP, as I mentioned.  In Q2 we successfully launched campaigns in Brazil, Canada, Australia, Thailand.  The objective is to try and bring another 1 million small medium businesses across 20 countries online for the first time.  As you know, more advertisers get more queries, have more ad serves against it, resulting in a more robust option for us.
 In addition, we also saw strong results from our own advertising campaigns, including the most recent one around Google Chrome -- The Web is What You Make of It.  I'm sure many of you might have seen Justin Bieber or Lady Gaga in these campaigns.  These campaigns have shown tremendous effectiveness and have helped convince more users to switch to the Chrome browser.
 Last, but not least, I want to spend a quick minute on talking about something we are more and more passionate about, which is continuing to drive better customer satisfaction on an advertising front.  We continue to improve service and support across all customer segments.
 We have started providing a large set of advertisers proactive phone support and on-boarding help, which include signing up for campaign building, signing up and getting assistance, as well as free (inaudible) support after they become a customer of ours.  As a result of these initiatives and others, spending by our small businesses continue to accelerate.
 Overall, as Patrick and Larry mentioned, Q2 was a great quarter.  I'm very proud of the work of our teams across the world in various countries who have done tremendous amount of effort to serve our customers, partners and users.
 Now I'm going to turn over to my business partner, Susan, who is going to talk about all the positive impact that her products have had this quarter. 

Susan Wojcicki,  Google - SVP, Advertising    [6]

           Thanks, Nikesh.  Larry started the call by talking about a few of the quarter's product highlights, and I would like to cover some more of them.
 So let me begin with search.  We are always looking for new ways to help our users find answers to their questions.  This quarter we brought two of the most popular mobile search innovations to the desktop, voice search and search by image.
 Voice search traffic for mobile devices is up 6 times in the past year.  So we thought this would be a useful feature for our desktop users as well.  It is especially useful for searches that you know how to say, but not how to spell.  Like Bolognese sauce or Schenectady, New York, neither of which I could easily spell.
 With Search by Image you can drop pictures of places, art or even mysterious creatures like the Loch Ness monster right into the Google search box, and Google can identify it and tell you about those pictures.
 In addition to these changes, we released about 100 other quality improvements to the search algorithm.  More and more people are searching and using apps for mobile phones, where Android has had terrific momentum.  There are now 135 million Android devices that have been activated in total, up from 100 million just two months ago.  There are also now over 400 different Android devices available globally.
 The Android market is also picking up momentum.  It has over 250,000 different apps.  And users have downloaded apps over 6 billion times, which is double the downloads from just a few months ago.
 We are expanding beyond apps too.  This week we started renting movies and selling books on phones from Android Market, and earlier in Q2 we launched Music Beta, which lets users upload their personal music collections and playlists to the cloud.  All of this media, movies, music, books and apps are instantly available on their Android devices, no cable required.
 Smartphones are also becoming key to the shopping experience.  Making shopping mobile and local is a vision behind Google Wallet and Google Offers.  We announced the Google Wallet mobile app in May in partnership with Citi, MasterCard, Sprint and First Data, and we are now testing it in field trials.  And as of this week, Google Offers are available in San Francisco, Oakland, New York and Portland.
 So now onto ads, which is the product area that I manage.  On the [search outside] we had a great quarter for quality, with over 50 ads quality improvements, and a big upgrade to the ads relevancy system.
 We launched the latest in a series of small tweaks for our search ad format.  This format, this quarter we added the landing URL to the headline so that users know where a click will take them.  This may seem like a small thing, but we launched several of these small tweaks over the past year, and cumulatively they have had a big impact.
 There were also a lot of quality improvements across our Display Network, over 20 launches, making it one of our strongest quarters from a quality perspective.
 In general, display advertising is moving to a scientific model, based on technologies like real-time bidding.  With this technology when you land on a webpage, advertisers decide what they want to pay for the ad space and an auction is held, and the best ad is matched with the publisher's ad space.  The product it is a lot more efficient.  It provides better performance to both advertisers and publishers, and more relevant ads for users.  Real-time bidding is an important technology shift that we are investing heavily in.
 Invite Media, which is the buying platform for advertisers and agencies that we bought last year, has doubled its client list in the last year, with over 5 times growth outside of the US.
 Mobile display is starting to take off too, with traffic on the AdMob network up more than 3.5 times in the past year.  More and more of that traffic is coming from tablets, so we launched a new set of formats designed specifically for tablets.  These formats are Web-based.  They use HTML, and brand advertisers don't need to make different versions of their ads for different models.
 Nikesh also mentioned our great momentum with YouTube, where we are getting strong performance from YouTube skippable ads.  Because users can choose to skip these in-stream ads, the people who choose to watch them are much more engaged.
 More and more advertisers are choosing to make their ads skippable.  And now over one-third of in-stream ads on YouTube are in a skippable format, which is a pretty remarkable fact, given that we launched this format in December.
 Finally, I'd like to update our progress on Chrome.  Larry mentioned how we passed 160 million users, which is more than double year-on-year.  This quarter our partners Samsung and Acer started shipping Chromebooks in seven countries.  Chromebooks are designed to be fast, to just work, and to get better over time thanks to our automatic updates.  And they are now available through Amazon and Best Buy.
 Chromebooks are also available to schools and businesses via a subscription model.  The subscription includes Chromebooks, of course, administration, warranty, and support starting at $20 a month.
 So, overall, it was a very busy quarter for us.  But maybe the coolest thing we did was the Les Paul doodle we ran last month.  It was a guitar you could actually play, and users recorded over 40 million songs while it was up.  That is about five years of music.
 I am looking forward to hearing your questions and comments, and for now back to Patrick. 

Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP, CFO    [7]

           Thank you, Susan.  So, Jamie, our operator is going to help us through this.  Jamie, you can just set up the call for a Q&A.  And, as I said, we will have Susan, Nikesh, Larry and myself to answer any questions you may have.



Questions and Answers
Operator    [1]

     (Operator Instructions).  Spencer Wang, Credit Suisse. 

Spencer Wang,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [2]

     Two quick questions, if I could.  First, for Patrick or perhaps Nikesh, international revenue growth, as you mentioned, was really strong.  I was wondering if you could just provide a little bit more color on perhaps what is driving that?  If you could give us a sense of how much of that is core search versus some of the newer initiatives like mobile, YouTube and display?
 Then the second question is for Larry.  I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit, Larry, about the patent strategy.  Our understanding is you guys have about 650 patents.  So just given the Oracle situation, I was wondering if you could talk about the patent strategy to ensure that you guys can continue to innovate going forward?  Thanks. 

Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP, CFO    [3]

     So I will let Nikesh answer the first part of the question, and then Larry will talk about the patent issues. 

Nikesh Arora,  Google - SVP, Chief Business Officer    [4]

     As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that we have seen tremendous growth across pretty much all product areas.  So the growth you are seeing international is driven by mobile, by display, by search.
 Clearly, international is not one market.  There are many different countries, so we have seen different effects in different markets.  Places like Japan, as I said, have been driven more by display and mobile.  Various parts of Asia are just getting up the curve for us on display and are strong contributors in mobile.
 Having said that, Russia has been very strong for us.  Brazil has been very strong for us.  Brazil on the back of mobile and display as well, and as well as core search.
 So if you think about it, what we are seeing, we are seeing more and more pickup of display and mobile, because we have established sales teams now pretty much on almost every major market around the world to help sell display.  And the mobile take-up based on take-up of smartpoints phones and Android, etc., is helping that trend as well.
 In addition to that, a lot of effort has gone into bringing small business online, and that increases the number of advertisers in many international markets.  As we get more advertisers in our international markets, it has a very positive impact on our RPMs in those markets, so we are seeing that effect as well. 

Larry Page,  Google - CEO    [5]

     Thank you for your question on Android and patents and so on.  Obviously, we have a number of intellectual property in progress too, not just already issued.
 I would also just say Android is really on a tear.  I mentioned there are over 550,000 new Android daily activations previously.  And there is over 400 such devices, 39 OEMs, 231 carriers and 123 countries, and over 78 Open Handset Alliance partners.  And that velocity is only increasing.
 Now, of course, despite the efforts of some of our competitors there hasn't been any slowdown in any of this.  And partners and developers are continuing to expand the Android ecosystem.  I should say, of course, we are really committed to Android, and continue to support that platform and ecosystem, and do it in a cost effective manner. 

Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP, CFO    [6]

     Thanks, Larry.  Let's go to the next question.  And thanks, Spencer, for your question. 

Operator    [7]

     Mark Mahaney, Citi. 

Mark Mahaney,  Citi - Analyst    [8]

     Two questions, Larry.  Could you talk about what you have maybe put in to improve the velocity of decision-making?  And as you step back and think about the management improvements you could see over the next year or two, how significant do you think -- how much better, how much more efficiently do think Google could be run than what we have seen maybe over the last two or three years?
 Then, Susan, real quickly, social search signals, how important do you think they are now?  How key are they?  How much of that is Google+ is the strategy for trying to make the core search results more relevant?  Thanks. 

Larry Page,  Google - CEO    [9]

     Thanks, this is Larry.  Sorry about that.  I am super excited about the changes we have made.  I think as companies scale, we always change how we are running the Company over time.  So I think we have much more of a product-focused structure now, which I am very excited about and talked about it.
 I think that maintaining and improving our velocity and execution is really a noble goal for us, and it requires always a lot of work in companies.  And I think that is a super important direction for us, and I'm really excited about it. 

Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP, CFO    [10]

     Susan, on social. 

Susan Wojcicki,  Google - SVP, Advertising    [11]

     So I think the first thing I would say about social is that we're very early right now.  And really our focus with Google+ will be to focus on making sure that we have a wonderful consumer and user experience.
 From a targeting perspective, there are a number of signals that we use right now.  Obviously, keyword on search, contextual interest-based advertising, demographics.  So social and social signals over time can be an important part of that, but it would be one of multiple ways that we actually do targeting.
 When we did rollout Google+, we do have pluses on all the ads, just as we do on search results.  So if a user does click on it and someone on their circle has -- actually does a query and triggers that, then there will be social annotations, which will be useful information for the user to see that their friend have +1 that ad. 

Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP, CFO    [12]

     Thank you Susan.  Thank you Larry. 

Operator    [13]

     Ben Schachter, Macquarie. 

Ben Schachter,  Macquarie - Analyst    [14]

     Congratulations on the execution and the launch of Google+.  Larry, at a high level, what, if any, are some of the key differences in how you think about managing specifically the economic model of the Company today versus when Eric was CEO, specifically, any changes to target margins, revenue growth targets, etc.?
 Then, separately, on mobile search specifically, it has clearly been successful in terms of search share.  But when we are trying to figure out the overall impact to net revenue and kind of balancing out some of the positives like incremental searches and share gains and higher click-through rates, but also having the headwinds of tax payments for partners and lower CPCs, how should we think about the overall net impact of mobile to the business?  Thanks. 

Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP, CFO    [15]

     So why don't I take the second part of that question, and then Larry can talk about the economic model versus -- in the context of what you said.
 Look, for mobile search you have to go back and focus on what we focus on -- build -- businesses that are going to be $1 billion businesses, and that actually contribute significant operating dollar margin.  These are businesses that scale to a humongous scale as they grow.
 So for us, that is the focus that we have.  And the second piece in the specifics of mobile is we really see mobile a bit like search was in 2001, 2002, 2003.  All these formats are so new that you know that there is so much more room for optimization on top of it.
 It is, in fact, a bit of a mistake to say, okay, today whatever we have is a good proxy for what the future will look like.  And that is why we are excited about it, and that is why it we focus so much on mobile.
 Now for the economic model and how we run the Company, maybe, Larry, your thoughts on that. 

Larry Page,  Google - CEO    [16]

     Absolutely, thanks for the question.  I think, certainly, Eric is a great partner and leader for me and for Google for the last 10 years and continues to play a big part in the Company.  So I don't think there is -- like we said before, there is no major changes in what we are doing.
 I will reiterate maybe a little bit -- add a little detail to what I already said.  I think about really in our products in three separate categories.  And first there is search in our ads business, which is the core driver revenue for the Company.  We really invest in that, we work hard on it.
 Next, we have businesses that are enjoying really high consumer success, for example, YouTube, Android and Chrome.  And we invest in those in order to optimize really their long-term success.  And we have some new businesses -- Google+, Commerce and Local -- that we are really excited about and are pretty early stage, and those things we invest in as well.
 We don't do things that we don't think will generate really big returns over time.  So we are optimizing for our long-term economic success.  But we do have these very different buckets of things that we work on. 

Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP, CFO    [17]

     Thanks for your answer, Larry.  Thanks for your question, Ben.  Jamie, let's go to the next question, please. 

Operator    [18]

     Ross Sandler, RBC. 

Ross Sandler,  RBC - Analyst    [19]

     Just two questions.  First, on Google+ and then second on Google Offers.  So, on Plus, we haven't seen any real integration -- I know it is only a couple weeks old -- but with Google's core competencies around search and other things that you have been very successful at in the past.  So can you talk about plans on integrating some of Google's core strengths into Google+ to further, I guess, differentiate the product from other services that are out there?
 And then on Google Offers can you just talk about your overall strategy in terms of rolling out offers?  You are in four cities today.  How fast do you think you're going to accelerate into these newer cities?  And is international territories also on the roadmap in the near term for Offers?  Thanks. 

Larry Page,  Google - CEO    [20]

     Thanks for your question.  I will answer the first part.  It is Larry.  Google+ actually has a lot of interesting product integration.  The black Google bar that you see is an entry point and notification point for Plus across basically all of our properties.  And we are really excited about that, and think it is a big deal.
 [I should also say] and there are many things that you would do with Plus and with +1 that affect what you would see in search results.  Like I mentioned, if +1 something your friends will see it in search.  So, absolutely, I hope I was clear that was our strategy, but we are very focused on improving all of Google, improving the sharing and identity across all of Google. 

Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP, CFO    [21]

     Maybe Nikesh can give a comment on the rollout for the Google Offers. 

Nikesh Arora,  Google - SVP, Chief Business Officer    [22]

     Thanks, Patrick.  We won't give out details on how we rollout our offers strategy.  I think Susan said it very well in our overall strategy.  Because Offers for us is not just an isolated event, it is a combined sort of a Commerce offering, which includes their mobile phone and other things we talked about.
 We are very happy with the rollout we have had in the one city where we have been for a while, which is Portland, and we just rolled out two more cities earlier this week.
 So from that perspective you can expect us to rollout other cities, but we are going to be testing and looking at the model to see what is working, what is not working, because we want to build the next version of how we rollout an Offers product.  So stay tuned. 

Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP, CFO    [23]

     Thanks for your question, Ross.  Jamie, our next question please. 

Operator    [24]

     Brian Pitz, UBS. 

Brian Pitz,  UBS - Analyst    [25]

     Two quick questions.  As we note the proliferation of the newer, richer ad formats like product image ads that we are seeing more and more on your side, can you help us better understand the impact on paid click growth specifically?
 Then, separately, can you also give us a little more color on some of the Panda or quality changes you are doing on the network?  Any commentary on how much impact to growth of AdSense that had this quarter?  And how long should we expect to see more than expected impact from continued quality changes?  Thanks. 

Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP, CFO    [26]

     Why don't I let, actually, Susan tackle those questions.  Susan. 

Susan Wojcicki,  Google - SVP, Advertising    [27]

     On the richer ad formats, we see a few important opportunities for us.  And what we feel about them is that gives us the opportunity to make those ads better for the users.  And as we can create better experiences for our users, they are more likely to have the information that a user wants, and so what we would hope to see is a click-through increase over time, and hopefully, for the advertiser on the backend, a better conversion.
 In terms of click growth, and what is actually driving the click growth that we see, it is a number of factors.  One of them is always going to be query growth that we have.  A second thing would have to -- would be on improvements that we have to our backend quality models.  So the better the quality model is, the more likely we are to actually match the right advertisement to the right user.
 We had a number of good -- as I mentioned, not just good, we had great ads quality launches this quarter.  And a number of ad formats that made the ads more readable, and by making them more readable the users are more likely to click on them, and that turns into click growth.
 Then on the last question that you had, which was Panda, Panda was a change made by the search team with the goal of improving overall search experience.  There was, as we talked about last time, some negative effects from the AdSense partners.  However, Panda does -- or any search quality that we make does have a change of ranking, which means that there different sites that wind up getting traffic.  And those sites may adjust their monetization strategies over time, and so it may just take some time for that to actually balance out.
 And, also, in terms of the last question, we don't really comment about future changes that we are going to make, but we are always thinking about the right way to continue to improve the search results for our users. 

Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP, CFO    [28]

     Panda is again -- once again, a great example of putting the user first ends up benefiting everybody in the end -- the publishers, the advertisers and the users.  Thanks for your question, Brian.  Let's go to our next question, please. 

Operator    [29]

     Justin Post, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 

Justin Post,  Bank of America Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [30]

     A couple of questions.  Larry, thanks for joining the call.  While we have you, I am just going to ask a question I get all the time.  How focused is senior management on the stock, either as an employee retention tool or a measure of management's performance over say a 3- to 5-year period?
 Then, secondly, if I could just ask about the local opportunity.  It looks a lot of launches happening for Google.  Do you see it as a different ad market than your current search ad market?  And how might your model be different than some of the larger players in that market currently?  Thank you. 

Larry Page,  Google - CEO    [31]

     Justin, thank you very much for your question.  This is Larry.  I think -- well, we have a lot of stuff to do here at Google and, unfortunately, one of the things we don't get to decide is our stock price.  So you all are in charge of that.
 I think we are -- and so we really focus on our long-term success as a business.  And the kind of things I mentioned already are absolute overall profitability over the long term and our revenue growth.  So we tend to focus much more on that with a much more long-term view than we do on our stock price. 

Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP, CFO    [32]

     Susan, views on the difference and the similarities between the local and our traditional ads market. 

Susan Wojcicki,  Google - SVP, Advertising    [33]

     Local can be thought about two different ways.  Local can be the large retailers who have many different points of presence.  So, for example, Starbucks or Pizza Hut or any retailer, which is a large holding company or one large retailer, but then has many different local points of presence.  And then there is a separate bucket, which are the small, Joe's Coffee Shop example.
 Both of them need different things from a product perspective in order to be able to advertise more broadly.  We are working in both buckets to solve and make them advertisers on AdWords with solutions that will work for them.
 The large ones need functionality of how do I run a campaign in all of these different locations with different keywords, different pricing?  And so we are working to enable location in our AdWords campaigns when you are managing a large account to make that much easier.
 The Joe's Coffee Shop example, what we are working on is enabling signing up for AdWords to be a much easier experience.  So we actually have a product that we release this quarter called Google Boost.  And Boost product is a one-page, 5-minute sign up for advertisers.  It is very easy to sign up.  We haven't marketed it a lot right now.  But we have seen good success with advertisers, and we're hoping to make that more known to our advertisers. 

Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP, CFO    [34]

     The last piece in the puzzle is obviously, Susan, mobile, which is completely integrated from an ads perspective and targeting as well. 

Susan Wojcicki,  Google - SVP, Advertising    [35]

     Yes.  So the other thing too is we would like to make all of our products be accessible from a mobile perspective.  Click-to-call would be an example.  Click-to-call is really nice so that if someone, for example, is local, walking down the street, they can actually call.  But it is also really nice from the small retailer perspective, because they can understand that they're getting a call and they're getting a lead, which for them would be much more tangible than actually a click to their page.  So we are investing very heavily in that in terms of click-to-call technology and the good tracking for the local advertisers. 

Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP, CFO    [36]

     Thank you.  And thanks Justin for your questions.  Let's go to our next question please. 

Operator    [37]

     Jeetil Patel, Deutsche Bank Securities. 

Jeetil Patel,  Deutsche Bank Securities - Analyst    [38]

     Two questions.  I guess, first of all, you've got obviously quite a few products and applications that have had success over the years kind of that are out there, obviously, search, Gmail, Chrome, Android, etc.
 I guess as you think about next generation of consumer relationship and stickiness, how do you think about like integrating a lot of these core assets together in terms of building a consumer relationship, which moves seamlessly from all these different solutions and formats out there as well as devices?
 Then, second, maybe around Google+, obviously it has been two weeks now, but maybe can you talk about the overall trend in terms of 10 million users?  How does that compare against maybe the early days of how Android or Chrome or maybe even search or mail ramped?  What kind of trajectory, what kind of trend schedule does it look like right now if you were to pinpoint it against another product in the business? 

Larry Page,  Google - CEO    [39]

     Thanks very much for the questions.  Those are good questions.  We are -- on the integration points, you know, we obviously have a lot of different products, so we do different things for different people.  And one effort that I mention I have been really excited about is this visual redesign.  I also mentioned the bar that goes across -- the black bar that goes across the Google+ that gives you notification and sharing and so on.
 We are definitely working hard to integrate our products better to make the user experience simpler, intuitive and beautiful and consistent.  I'm really excited about our progress just in one quarter on that.  And I think you will -- we are certainly working hard on that and expect to continue to over time.
 On the Plus growth question, we have been very, very excited about the growth we have seen and the engagement we have seen with the 1 -- over 1 billion items shared and received in a single day.  I think that for us there is a lot of barriers to use Plus right now.  One thing, you have to be invited and so on, and it is still in field trial.
 So I think, given all that, we are just extremely excited about that, but it is very early days.  It has less than two weeks since we released it into field trial. 

Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP, CFO    [40]

     Thanks for those insights, Larry.  Thanks for your question.  Jamie, let's go to the next question, please. 

Operator    [41]

     Jason Maynard, Wells Fargo. 

Jason Maynard,  Wells Fargo - Analyst    [42]

     I have a couple of questions.  First, on Local, you've got a lot of interesting services and capabilities, but there is still fairly disparate, and in some instances there's some overlapping features.  I am just curious from an end-user perspective, how are you thinking about bringing together your various local Commerce products?
 Then, maybe to follow up on the Google+ question, since it is so early, what are your longer-term goals for Plus?  Measured by either users or number of items shared, how are you thinking this over, say, a two-year timeframe?  Thank you. 

Larry Page,  Google - CEO    [43]

     Maybe, I will take the first question -- the second question first, on the Plus, how would we think about success of it.
 I think we are really -- obviously, like I said, we want people to make products that everybody uses twice a day like their toothbrush.  And we would certainly think about Plus that way, and also, just generally having really great sharing experience and identity experience across Google and all of its products.
 So that is how we think about Plus there.  I think it is pretty straightforward.
 On the first question, local integration, Patrick, do you want to take that (multiple speakers)? 

Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP, CFO    [44]

     Let me suggest that what has been really cool about Local for us, in addition to what Susan mentioned a few minutes ago is, you have to think of it as we are in fact assembling all the pieces of the puzzle.  Local is actually a quite complex experience, but when you have maps, you have mobile, you have wallet, you have all the ad serving you basically have the pieces of the puzzle to succeed.
 It is not as much what was yesterday's tool that we have, and how do we evolve only yesterday's tools.  It is about taking those pieces of the puzzle and really creating truly innovative services.  And that is how we have to think about Local.  And that is why it is not obvious.  But if you look at the arsenal we are building, it is actually quite formidable.  So that is why we are excited about it.
 Thanks, Jason, for your question.  Let's go to the next question. 

Operator    [45]

     Doug Anmuth, JPMorgan. 

Doug Anmuth,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [46]

     Thanks for taking the question.  I wanted to ask two things.  First, Patrick, can you give us some color on the mix of headcount additions?  And, in particular, if you look at R&D, it looks like it was flat sequentially.  But yet you added more than 2,000 people during the quarter, so I'm hoping you can provide some color there.
 Then, secondly, can you give us some context just in terms of how you think about the display business and whether you need more O&O inventory?  Thanks. 

Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP, CFO    [47]

     I will answer the first one, and then I will let Susan answer the second.  Listen, on headcount, again, as we said on the call, roughly we have ITA for 450, so roughly about 2,000 for the quarter.  And Larry commented on that.
 There is still a huge amount of engineers in that.  It just happens that R&D is actually in every line item.  So you will find in us, but you will find in many other areas of our P&L.
 And so you should not worry.  We have a complete focus to make sure that we actually have -- you know, a majority of our hiring that is focused on engineering, which is really the core of the business.  Then we continue to -- then you have the mix of sales and then just general overhead.  But it is really engineering and sales that have been the focus in that sequence.
 For display, I will let Susan talk about it. 

Larry Page,  Google - CEO    [48]

     I will just add too on the headcount question, none of the focus there has changed substantially from our past.  Go ahead, Susan. 

Susan Wojcicki,  Google - SVP, Advertising    [49]

     On display, our biggest O&O property is obviously YouTube.  And given the numbers that we saw, we have seen tremendous growth there and a huge opportunity to monetize video as more users come online and more content winds up being uploaded on YouTube.
 But the strategy in our display strategy overall is not -- it is dependent not just on O&O, it also has many other components, the first of being -- to be a platform to enable advertisers and publishers to much more easily buy and sell display advertising.
 And then, second, to enable all of the sites out there, which there are of course many, many, many millions -- hundreds of millions of them for them to be able to monetize and sell display advertising, and for us to be able to help them as part of that process, and via our network where we have a lot of different targeting techniques to try to serve the right ad to those users.
 So, really, our strategy is part O&O with our sites like YouTube, but then also to continue to build a great network and platform products so that advertisers and publishers across the industry can serve display advertising. 

Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP, CFO    [50]

     Thanks for your question.  Let's go to the next question. 

Operator    [51]

     Anthony Diclemente, Barclays Capital. 

Anthony Diclemente,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [52]

     I have one for Patrick and one for Larry.  Patrick, if we just isolate the 6% sequential growth in cost per click versus last quarter, I wonder if you could just help us understand the driver of that acceleration?  And moving forward should we expect that to continue or moderate given that as mobile queries start to take up more of the query mix?
 And then a question for Larry.  It would appear that in social media that switching costs for users are high -- perhaps years of photos on a social network platform.  As you look at Google+ and the growth there what are the most compelling offsets to the switching cost do you think, or do you perhaps see a future where folks can simultaneously be a part of multiple social networking platforms?  Thanks for the question. 

Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP, CFO    [53]

     So why do I let Susan actually give you a bit of color on our CPC and evolution, and then Larry will take on the latter -- the social one. 

Susan Wojcicki,  Google - SVP, Advertising    [54]

     The drivers of CPC, there are a few of them.  One of them this quarter was FX certainly.  But we have been really focused on our ads quality improvement, and how do we continue to, obviously, make our ads better for our users and for our advertisers.
 And in doing so we have actually -- we have done a lot of optimization of our ads that appear above the search results, like Site Links, some of the ad changes and the formats that we made this quarter.  And a lot of the ads that appear above the top search results tend to be higher CPC, because they are the first three ads.
 So as we continue to optimize and really drive a lot of increased click-through and visibility for the ads that appear above the search results, you will see -- since those tend to be higher CPC because they are at the top of the results, you will see some of that increase. 

Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP, CFO    [55]

     Larry, on social and switching costs. 

Larry Page,  Google - CEO    [56]

     So, I think we have been really excited about our Google+ really improving the overall social experience and making it more like how you would share in real life.
 That is really a different product than is out there now.  And we are getting just rave reviews for that.  People really like being able to share with more discrete groups in an easy way and intuitive way.  And there is a lot of magic built into the product that causes that.
 I will say, and you asked about photos, but we actually have a really good photo experience on Android.  Like if you take a picture on Android, and you have the Google+ client, which you would have if you are using it, it uploads your photos automatically.  And it's super easy to share them and post them to your friends or your family or whatever.  It is a really, really great experience.
 There is legacy, and Google as a company believes in users owning their own data, and being able to easily move it out of Google.  Some of our competitors don't believe in that.  But we think that users will eventually move to services that are in their best interest and they work really well for them. 

Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP, CFO    [57]

     Thank you for your question.  It is already 2.30, so why do we take, Jamie, one last question, and then we will have to close the call, unfortunately. 

Operator    [58]

     Jim Friedland, Cowen and Company. 

Jim Friedland,  Cowen and Company - Analyst    [59]

     I wanted to ask the question on -- or follow-up on where you guys said that you're a little ahead of where you expected it to be on hiring.  Should we think about the hiring, and particularly in R&D, sort of coming in waves where you hire a bunch of people, get them integrated, maybe it slows down and picks up again?
 And then the second question test and just on the P&L, other costs of revenue as a percentage of [res dex tack] seemed to be a little high.  Is that coming from increased data center depreciation or is it may be coming from YouTube and content-related costs?  Thanks. 

Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP, CFO    [60]

     I will answer the first one, and then -- the latter one -- and then I will let Larry talk about hiring in general.  The P&L, yes, it is a combination of factors this quarter.  So in that cost is also included headcount.  And, so headcount has actually increased.  Power has increased because of seasonality.  It is summer now, so our power is a little higher.  And we have also had kind of catch-up on expenses on some of the equipment.
 So there has been a bit of a -- if you think between Q1 and Q2 there has been a bit of a cleanup in some of the areas of equipment that have actually slightly deflated Q1 and inflated Q2 as we finish the cleanup.  So there was a bit of a catch-up there.
 So I wouldn't read the data point between Q1 and Q2 as -- don't create a graph with that -- with the line.  But that is -- it is a bit of everything, including a bit of cleanup in some of the equipment accounts.
 For the issue of hiring, I will let Larry actually talk about general, where we stand right now. 

Larry Page,  Google - CEO    [61]

     Yes, that is a great question.  I think just a couple of factors that affected that.  And I think -- you know we implemented compensation changes in Q1.  We increased our employee compensation.  And they have had even more positive effect on hiring and retention than when we expected.  That has been a super successful change.
 I think, in general, there is just more excited people who want to work at Google and who want to stay working at Google than we expected.  So that has had some impact on those numbers.
 There is -- of course, there is a limit on how many we can -- and how fast we can productively hire.  I said, as in my remarks, I think my judgments were at the edge of that piece being reasonable.  We are just adding a lot of people.
 I would say that we are always looking for good people, and we are always -- the exact rate is going to depend on success, and where we really want to invest in the Company.
 We have a really strong management team, I said, that is working together fabulously.  We can absorb those hires and put them to use well.  But, like I said, we are definitely -- we are surprised at the success of our previous changes around compensation as well. 

Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP, CFO    [62]

     Thank you very much for your question, Jim.  With that, I just want to thank Larry for joining us today, and the Nikesh and Susan for their comments, as well as the Q&A.
 I want to thank -- once again, as I always do, all the Googlers out there, our fantastic Googlers that have made this quarter possible, and all of the innovation.  Especially, I think it is worth mentioning our Google+ team that had done a phenomenal job in this launch, so two thumbs up.  So on behalf of all of us here, congratulations and many thanks to all our gang at Google.
 With that, I will let you, Jamie, close the call.  And thank you everybody for participating today. 

Operator    [63]

     That does conclude today's conference.  We do appreciate everyone's participation.
