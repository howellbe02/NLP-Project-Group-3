Presentation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

           Good day and welcome everyone to the Google, Inc.  conference call.  This call is being recorded.  At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Ms.  Jane Penner, Senior Manager, Investor Relations. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jane Penner,  Google - IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

           Good afternoon everyone and welcome to today's second-quarter 2010 earnings conference call.  With us are Patrick Pichette, Chief Financial Officer; Jonathan Rosenberg, Senior Vice President Product Management; Nikesh Arora, President Global Sales Operations and Business Development.
 First, Jonathan and Patrick will provide us with their thoughts on the quarter and then Nikesh will join us to answer your questions.
 Also, as you know, last quarter we began distributing our earnings release exclusively through our Investor Relations website located at investor.google.com.  So going forward please refer to our IR website for our earnings releases, as well does supplementary slides that accompany the call.
 This call is also being webcast from investor.google.com.  A replay of the call will be available on our website in a few hours.
 Now let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor.  Some of the statements we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding Google's future and investments in our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our business, and our expected level of capital expenditures.
 These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.  Please note that these forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation, and we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.
 Please refer to our SEC filings for a more detailed description of the risk factors that may affect our results.  Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call, such as operating profit and operating margin, are expressed on a non-GAAP basis, and have been adjusted to exclude charges related to stock-based compensation.  We have also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capital expenditures, which we refer to as free cash flow.  Our GAAP results and non-GAAP reconciliation can be found in our investor -- in our earnings press release.
 With that, I will now turn the call over to Patrick. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

           Thank you, Jane.  Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us.  As Jane mentioned, Jonathan and I will begin with the preferred remarks, but we also have Nikesh with us for the Q&A.  So let me start you by giving you some high-level thoughts about the quarter, and then we will get into our detailed financial performance.
 So overall we are very pleased with our Q2 results.  We experienced continued solid growth in our core, but also very strong growth in our emerging businesses year-over-year.
 Taking a step back actually, these results reflect a few really important trends in the digital advertising.  First, we are really taking notice that more and more traditional brand advertisers are embracing search and search advertising as a way to build their brands online.
 A case in point, P&N.  It is one of the largest brand advertisers in the world and it is now one of our top advertisers in the US.
 Second, we see also a real trend in large advertising focusing on highly measurable, but also integrated campaigns across display, mobile and search.  So as a result we saw strength in every major product in Q3.
 Google.com was strong, with strong performance across major geographies and most major verticals, including CPG, retail, travel, etc.  Our growth in display was also very strong.  Our continued focus in this product area is clearly generating results.
 Our display network, which includes YouTube, is growing very rapidly.  The scale and quality of our network continues to increase, and we see increased demands from traditional brand advertisers in that space as well.
 In addition, we made yet another significant stride in display this week, when we entered into a strategic agreement with Omnicom Media Group.  We will be working together with Omnicom to codevelop their exchange trading desk for the DoubleClick Ad Exchange in the coming years.
 YouTube, specifically, we continue to see very impressive growth as brand advertisers also consider it a must buy.  For example, and as I mentioned a moment ago, in Q2 we ran World Cup advertising campaigns for major advertisers of the likes of Coke, Visa, Nike, Sony, etc.
 Finally, on YouTube, I think it is really worth noting that we're very pleased, of course, with the court's decision to rule in our favor in the Viacom case.  But more important than this victory, it is not for us, but for the users and just the Web in general.  Specifically for all the blogs in the community forums across the Web that do rely on this user generated content for sharing information and also for free expression.
 But we were very passionate about this issue at Google, and so much so that we have made a significant investment of approximately $100 million to win this case.  Once again, it just was the right thing to do, and we did it.
 In mobile our revenue continues to grow as advertisers increasingly opt into their mobile specific campaigns.  And with the successful completion of the AdMob transaction in Q2, our business is gaining momentum.  So we have a very competitive mobile advertising platform now.  Of course, underpinning our growth is the success of the Android platform Excel, with over -- as we announced a couple of weeks ago -- 160,000 devices activated daily.  That is two every second.  And it creates an even larger base of data centric smartphone users.
 Finally, enterprise had another good quarter with several high-profile deals, including, for example, Virgin America.  The world is simply moving into the cloud.
 Successful products do require investment.  That is why we are focusing our resources on products that, as you all know, leverage computer science to solve our big problems, offer great ROIs, and very large growth opportunities.
 For example, in Q2 we have added approximately 1,200 employees.  That is obviously counting the acquisitions of AdMob and the others.  But the majority is done in engineering and sales, and in the following product areas -- search monetization, display, mobile, apps, all the next billion-dollar businesses that are growing incredibly rapidly, and that is why we are investing in them.  Jonathan will give you more details about that in a moment.
 So now let me turn to our financial results.  Gross revenue.  Gross revenue grew 24% year-over-year to $6.8 billion.  Our Google website's revenue was also up 23% year-over-year to $4.5 billion, with strength, as I mentioned, across most geographies and verticals.  Our AdSense revenue was up 23% as well to $2.1 billion, reflecting our continued strength, specifically in the Google display network.
 Other revenue was up also 39% year-over-year to $258 million.  And it includes the last quarter of revenue from the sale of Nexus One.  As announced, we are discontinuing the direct-to-consumer channel in Q3, and as a result, beyond Q3 we won't recognize any revenue or cost associated with the sale of Nexus One.  They are still being sold through various carrier partners, both in the US and Europe, however.
 Our global aggregate paid click growth remained quite healthy, up 15% year-over-year, and down 3% quarter-over-quarter due to the typical summer seasonality.  Aggregate cost-per-click growth was up 4% year-over-year and 2% quarter-over-quarter.  Note that the FX had a positive impact on our CPC growth year-over-year and a negative one quarter over quarter.  Remember too that this is an aggregate number, and it includes both google.com and our AdSense properties.
 Turning now to our geographic performance.  On a relative basis the UK dragged a bit the global economic recovery, certainly relative to the US and rest of world which were strong.  Revenue from the US was up 26% year-over-year to $3.3 billion.  And in our earnings slide you will find on our Investor website, you will see that we have broken down our revenue by US, UK and rest of world to show you the impact of the FX and benefit from our hedging programs.  So please refer to these slides for these calculations.
 International revenue accounted for 52% of our total revenue, or $3.5 billion, also up 21% year-over-year, which includes $79 million benefits from our hedging programs.  This is compared to $124 million of benefits in Q2 of last year.
 If we use fixed exchange rates our international revenue would have been roughly $24 million lower year-over-year.  The UK was up 8% year-over-year to $770 million.
 Let me now turn to expenses.  Traffic acquisition costs were $1.7 billion, or 26% of our total advertising revenue.  Our cost of revenue was $735 million,, including stock-based compensation of $8 million, and also expenses related to the sale of Nexus One.
 Finally, all operating expenses totaled $2 billion.  This is also including $301 million of stock-based compensation.  The increase in year-over-year OpEx is really primarily due to increases in payroll, professional services and advertising and promotional spend.
 So as a result of all this, our non-GAAP operating profit, which excludes stock-based compensation, increased to $2.7 billion in Q2, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 39%, essentially the same as last year.
 As I mentioned already, our head count was up approximately 1,200 heads versus Q1, and in the quarter with 21,805 full-time employees, and again that reflects the acquisitions as well.
 Our effective tax rate was up to 24% in Q2 versus 22% in Q1, essentially due to the mix of earnings between domestic and international subsidiary, and the impact of our hedging program.  Let me quickly turn to cash management.
 Other income and expense was 69% for Q2 -- $69 million, I am sorry, for Q2, which includes good progress in our portfolio management performance, although it was somewhat offset by the impact of our hedging expenses with FASB 133.  For more detail on the OI&E, again, please refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR website.
 In addition, we have announced today a $3 billion commercial paper program in a related credit facility.  This to us is an important step in establishing a more capital efficient structure that will provide us with low cost working capital availability and flexibility.  It is also an excellent time to do it, given the historical low interest rates.
 Operating cash flow was very strong at $2.1 billion.  CapEx for the quarter was $476 million, again primarily related to our data center operations.  And as a reminder, we continue to make significant CapEx investments, and it just turned out to be lumpy from quarter to quarter.  Our free cash flow, therefore, stands at $1.6 billion, and a very good position.
 So if you take a step back from all these numbers, here is where we stand.  We are very pleased with our Q2 performance, seeing growth across revenue, margin and cash flow.  And it really paints a picture of where we are very confident of our future.  That is why we continue to attract and hire among the best talent in the world to further invest in our growth agenda.
 So with that, and before we open up to questions, let me turn it to Jonathan for his comments. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jonathan Rosenberg,  Google - SVP, Product Management    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

           Okay, well, thanks, Patrick.  So let me start with search.  Search used to be pretty simple.  You would enter a query and we would return a bunch of links to websites.  But now the Web is much, much more complicated.  There is videos; there is books; there is music; there is news, just about any type of media you can name is online.  So the scale of the Web now is grand, and it isn't slowing down.
 To keep pace we migrated a lot of our index to a new infrastructure, which we call Caffeine.  And Caffeine is basically a new way of updating our index.  So now when we find a new webpage, or new information like a video or an image, we had them straight to the index without a delay.  This means that the results that you get are a lot fresher, and in fact, they are about 50% fresher than before.
 But then once you get your results, you need tools to work with them to get to the right answer.  We have launched a new UI that has a bunch of options on the left hand side to help you filter those results.  I especially like the timeline feature, which I think is great when you're doing research and you want to see results from a particular time.  So you can enter say, oil spill, and click on timeline and 1969, and you can read all about the big Santa Barbara spill that led to the ban on offshore drilling in California.
 On the other hand, sometimes you just want an answer.  The query is effectively the result.  We are getting much better at knowing when that is the case and giving you what you need.  So enter, for example, Barack Obama birthday, and you'll see what I mean.  You will see his birthday listed, August 4, 1961, and citations for the different sources where we got that information.
 All this works and suggests too.  Try typing, capital South Africa.  By the time you get to the first A in Africa, we tell you it is Pretoria.
 I point all these things out because the great things about features like these is most people I think don't even notice the changes.  They just notice they get their answers fast.
 I think I mentioned on the earnings call back in January but we are working on putting more wood behind fewer arrows, and search innovation is definitely one of those arrows.  Our pace here is actually accelerating.  Voice search added six languages.  We launched spelling full-page replacement, suggest with spell corrections, and over 100 quality enhancements.  So there is lots of stuff going on.  In fact, there is so much that we are putting out a weekly blog post to document all the search improvements.
 But interestingly, as search gets better, it actually creates another huge challenge for us, the ads need to keep pace and get better too, otherwise, what would happen is people will click on relatively fewer ads and that -- well, that would be bad.
 So this dynamic where consumers are in control holds for all types of media, and not just search.  It used to be consumers had to watch, see, or listen to whatever the advertiser wanted to show, but now they don't.
 I think this is a fundamental shift for the advertising industry.  When people don't have to watch your ads, what do you do?  Well, you have to make ads people actually want to watch.  I was in Piazza San Marco in Venice a couple of weeks ago, and there was this huge billboard advertising a ski jacket.  It was like 90 degrees and we were sweating in shorts and T-shirts.  I looked and I thought, what a waste of money.  So I took a photo of the ad with my smartphone, and I sent it to my team as proof there is lots of upside in improving ads.
 This quarter we made great progress on that upside.  We added new ad formats and we focused even more on quality.  The new formats let advertisers put more useful information into their ads, such as pictures of a product or a local address or a phone number.  It turns out that when you're searching for something from your phone, you are much more likely to click on the ad when it has a phone address in it.  This seems obvious to you, but now we actually know from the data that is true.
 One of our customers, Carnival Cruises, increased bookings from mobile phones by 175% when they included click-to-call ads.  Lastly on ads, I know you often ask about headroom in ads quality.  I am thrilled to say we had one of our most productive quarters there in the last couple of years.  Over a dozen launches on search with a strong impact on revenue.
 We did things like put better ads on the second page of results, where we realize that the ads weren't as good.  And we also had over 20 quality improvements on the Google display network.
 Display, by the way, is going very well.  One recent development is that we are working closely with our agency partners to help them move to what they call an audience buying model.  I think this is another fundamental shift in advertising, where the ultimate goal is to designate a particular audience on our network, like say, women between 18 and 35, who like basketball.  And then we automatically target that audience for you.
 We are also making progress with features like remarketing, which we launched last quarter.  Advertisers can reach people who have already visited their sites.  Interest-based advertising, which we launched last year is also working very well.  And so is the DoubleClick Ad Exchange, which we launched in Q3.  We've got several of the top ad networks on it, and we are attracting some big buyers like agency holding companies.
 Advertisers really like the technology, which is real-time bidding.  And publishers like that is open to all advertisers and ad networks, who would they want to work with.
 We want to be open in everything we do.  We believe open systems are better for the Web; they're better for competition; they're better for the user.  This is not philanthropy.  When the Web is better, more people use it more often, and that means they search more often.  Android is a leading example of this.  As Patrick mentioned, we are now activating over 160,000 Android devices every day.  This is up from 65,000 last quarter.
 What is even more interesting there is that most of these devices are developed completely independently of Google.  One of those is the Sprint EVO, which is actually my favorite phone right now.  It has a big screen; it has got great video; it acts as a Wi-Fi hotspot for me.  It has 4G bandwidth, at least when you are around MountainView.
 The Android market is also open, of course, and now has over 70,000 apps.  That was around 30,000 in April.  As you look at all these new apps being created, you also realize that your mobile phone isn't alone anymore.  It is actually connected to several million computers 24 by 7.  This is letting us do things that we used to think were impossible.
 We just released a new version of Goggles that lets you take a picture of something in another language with your phone, and it translate it for you.  I actually use this a lot to read menus on my vacation in Italy.  You literally don't have to guess what you're going to eat anymore.  Or say you want to read about how the locals are celebrating their World Cup victory.  Congratulations to Spain, by the way.  Anyway, you just go to ElPais.com, and [Chrome to] automatically translate it for you in a second.
 So Cloud Computing also means that enterprises can take advantage of these innovations.  We just launched this feature where if you have say a PDF or the image of the scanned document, you can upload it to docs, and we will convert it to text, so you can edit it.  You don't have to install any special software or anything.  If you are a Google Apps customer it is just there, and it works.
 Of course, the cloud is pretty good for wasting time too.  I hope you played with our special Pac Man doodle.  We put it up on May 22 to celebrate Pac-Man's 30th birthday.  And we estimate people spent 4.8 million hours playing it.  If you missed it, go to google.com/Pac-Man.  Thank you for your time.  Back to Patrick.

Patrick Pichette,  Google - CFO    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

           Thank you, Jonathan.  And yes, there was these great reports of billions of billions of kind of productivity lost over that little Pac-Man, so obviously we did something right somewhere.
 Connie, can you actually turn on the Q&A process.  And I am going to invite Nikesh to also join us at this time.

     (Operator Instructions).  James Mitchell, Goldman Sachs. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
James Mitchell,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Thank you very much, and thank you for the Pac-Man distraction a few weeks ago.  My question was about the sequential increase in operating expenses.  I was wondering if there was any adjustment to bonus accruals that went into that sequential increase, or was it entirely due to headcount additions and acquisitions and marketing? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The bonus accrual would have a small impact on it.  So it is really about headcount, about TVCs, about marketing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spencer Wang,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Two quick questions.  First, in terms of the paid click growth, the 15%, I was wondering if you could just give us a sense of how much of that is coming from mobile today currently versus say last quarter.
 Then the second question, maybe for Patrick, just on TAC, it was done a little bit year-over-year flat sequentially.  Can you just give us a sense of where you think, on a percentage basis, that is trending, especially with the MySpace deal coming up shortly?  Thank you. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jonathan Rosenberg,  Google - SVP, Product Management    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     This is Jonathan on the mobile question.  Mobile is certainly growing faster than other clicks.  So everything else being constant, there is a disproportionately larger group of mobile clicks this quarter than in quarters in the past, but we don't really have any more detail than that. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - CFO    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     In the case of TAC, it has been -- most of the TAC that we have today -- because as you said so rightly the MySpace deal is ending now -- I mean, we shouldn't see any -- there is no big jump anywhere in the TAC going forward.  It has been pretty stable, actually around -- I think you said 27% or -- and so there is very little variability in it.

     Imran Khan, JPMorgan. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Imran Khan,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Two quick questions.  One, the 1,200 or so headcount increase, could you give us some sense of where are you locating those headcount?  Is it in search or most of the headcounts are going to new initiative?
 Also, secondly, in terms of the cost-per-click, can you give us some sense the differences of cost-per-click mobile versus desktop, and how quickly you think it can narrow?  Thank you. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - CFO    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Great.  So why don't I start with the 1,200.  So remember 1200, just to give a bit of clarification, there is probably around 300 of those 1,200 that in estimate that come from M&A.  So really organically, if you think about it, more like 900, which was not unlike last quarter.
 I mentioned in my core notes, most of the headcount is in engineering and sales.  And most of the headcount, like a vast majority, is going to the four core areas of focus of the Company.  So they are about search and search monetization.  They are going to mobile and Android.  They are going to apps and they are going to display.  We see so much momentum in each of these right now, that that is where the bulk of the resources are going, because that is where the focus of the Company is.
 On the CPC, Nikesh. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nikesh Arora,  Google - President Global Sales Ops and Business Development.    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     On the CPC -- hi, this is Nikesh -- on the CPC, I don't think there is enough data for us to actually look at the trend in terms of it is closing or not.  But you have to understand, the mobile advertiser sees mobile as a very different platform vis-a-vis the desktop advertiser.  You see high CPCs where there are transactions that can be consummated on the mobile, i.e., in digital entertainment.  You don't see as high CPCs as when you're trying to give directions to a certain restaurant or a place where they might conduct commerce.
 So there is still some disparity between the CPCs in the desktop and mobile.  Within mobile, depending on the verticals, there is disparity depending on the type of advertiser.  (multiple speakers).

     Justin Post, Bank of America. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Justin Post,  Bank of America - Analyst    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     My questions are about Android.  Can you talk about how much investment is going into that platform?  And then how do you think about it?  Is this an investment that just needs to keep going just so you can compete in the mobile market?  Or -- you're not charging for it, is this is a real installed base revenue opportunity, and we are going to start hearing more communication about how you're going to monetize it down the road?  Thank you. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - CFO    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     So let me give you a high-level answer to give everybody comfort.  Android is not -- in terms of cost, it is not material to the Company.  Not only that, but let me give you a further kind of proof point of the value of Android is, some of the key products that have been launched over the last few weeks and few months have not been developed by Google at all.  I think the last Android X or Motorola -- what is it -- Droid X, has been developed by Motorola directly with Verizon and not involving any of the Google resources.
 So it is not a use resource investment.  It is a formidable return in that what you have is the entire ecosystem exploding.  I will let Jonathan give you really the sense of that one.  So from a cost side it is not material. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jonathan Rosenberg,  Google - SVP, Product Management    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     We gave some data just on the scope of the numbers, the 160,000 Android devices, as well as the growth in apps from 30,000 to 70,000.  But I think the most important and most obvious thing to think about from our perspective is what is the most popular app on these devices.  The most popular app is a browser.  What do people do with the browser on these devices?  They search an order of magnitude more than they have on any previous type of smartphones which they have had in years past.
 So the combination of people browsing on these smartphones connected on very, very fast networks, and searching on them, is basically the formula around how Google makes -- how Google succeeds. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Justin Post,  Bank of America - Analyst    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     I have also got a follow-up.  But are you seeing search activity really strong on mobile devices with Android?  And do you think you're losing any ground relative to search activity within applications? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jonathan Rosenberg,  Google - SVP, Product Management    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Android search grew 300% in the first half of 2010.  So, yes, search on Android devices is exploding. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - CFO    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     I think another way to frame it in numerical numbers, I mean, the mobile has grown 500% in the last two years in terms of the traffic.  So think of that, and then think of Android being an accelerator of that, because every time you bring the NPV of all these platforms coming forward, you get a lot more.  So that is how to think about the problem and the solution that we bring.

     Doug Anmuth, Barclays Capital. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Doug Anmuth,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Two things I wanted to ask.  First, just on the macro environment, can you comment on what you saw at all during Q2 in terms of whether the environment seemed to change at all, either in the US or Europe?
 Then, secondly, just given the $3 billion commercial paper program, can you update your current thoughts on returning cash potentially to shareholders?  Thank you. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - CFO    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Let me start with the last one first.  Really the commercial paper is a fantastic opportunity for us, given the portfolio that we have put in place for our cash to actually have the working capital flexibility around it.  So now if I need working capital for my day-to-day operations, I have that flexibility through commercial paper, and that is really the essence of what we are doing.
 We have made no decisions at all on share buybacks or -- as I said to everyone, it is a topic that is regularly debated, brought to the Board for debate, and we have nothing to announce on that one.
 On the macro side I would say, look, there's kind of two things.  Everybody reads the press; everybody has seen everything that happened in Q2.  The Europe, the debt, the this or that.
 For us at Google it has been a great quarter.  We have had -- our business has been a great quarter.  We have seen no impact of what is going on in the macro world to us.  That is why we said for the last three, four quarters -- we have said we are really pleased with how we are performing in this kind of economy.  And that is why we feel confident about the future and feel confident about investing now.  That is why we are doing it.

     Would you talk about your advertiser and user adoption of some of the new product ad formats that we are actually seeing on your site?  Are these ads having a material impact on CPCs, because we understand they are being sold on a CPA basis.  Thanks. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jonathan Rosenberg,  Google - SVP, Product Management    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     This is Jonathan.  I can give you a quick review of the top formats, and then maybe Nikesh can chime in and give you a sense of some of the specific customer experiences that he has had.
 The click-to-call adds on the high-end mobile phones are doing very well.  The click through rates go up 6% when you put ads with a phone number, 8% when you put a local address.  So click-to-call is doing very well.
 It is easy to see some of those, if you want to see take a look for yourself.  If you try travel agency from a smartphone, you will see them.  There are thousands of active campaigns on click-to-call, so you can take a look at that.
 Sitelinks is also making pretty good progress.  We have given you examples on past calls where you type a big brand like Sears, and then you see the more useful links that you can get through.  And the click through rates on those can go up as much as 30% over the ads without the Sitelink.  But we changed the way we do Sitelinks, and we have added a new one-line format.  And that also allows Sitelinks to show up in more places.  You can try Flowers, if you want to see that.
 The other format that is getting some adoption is the -- we are adding the seller ratings, which shows merchants' ratings out of six stars aggregated from reviews on the Web.  You see that if you look for things like digital cameras.  And that is doing pretty well as well. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - CFO    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Nikesh, any further thought? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nikesh Arora,  Google - President Global Sales Ops and Business Development.    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     No, I guess from an advertiser perspective, they have always had a sense that over the last few years we have actually had some disparity in the quality of our natural search and quality for ads.  And things like Sitelinks create tremendous disparity between what people get in natural search and what they get from an ad format.  So there is tremendous appetite on our large advertisers to be able to send their consumers or users to a deeper part of their website, which Sitelink allows.
 The adoption of Sitelinks, the adoption of click-to-call, a call as Jonathan said, is extremely more lucrative for them, because they can actually track it, and they can actually track the transaction that it creates.  So these new ad formats are definitely helping, and are getting out there.
 One thing which Jonathan did not touch upon is the ad innovation on the display side as well.  We have had tremendous new formats we have launched on the whole YouTube front, where we actually increase the inventory, because we get more and more content where we can show ads on.
 In addition to that, we also have a new ad formats, which effectively -- imagine a basic ad, and now getting it to be a auto expandable mass type that shows up on YouTube, which allows us to impact the pricing of the ad format.
 So the more richer the ad, the more an advertiser is willing to contribute, because it creates a more engaging experience, and therefore a higher revenue opportunity.
 So I think across-the-board the new ad formats are both -- we are seeing more appetite for them.  And at the same time they are allowing us to create more return for the advertiser, allowing us to price them better.

Ross Sandler,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Just two quick questions.  Patrick, you said the cost for Android are fairly immaterial, so can you talk about the operating margins in the display business on a revenue ex-TAC basis?  How much of the margin compression that you are seeing right now is coming from display growing faster than search?
 And then, second question is it looks like the ROW region accelerated a bit in the second quarter, if you strip out the hedging and currency impact.  Can you talk about, Nikesh, which regions are driving that?  And can you specifically talk about the environment in Europe, given the macro.  I know you talked about it for a second earlier, but just any further color about Continental Europe.  Thanks. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - CFO    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The display business has, to a certain extent, if you take it as a blended, slightly lower margins, if you take the DoubleClick platform, for example, which is more transactional.  But overall I think that they still are quite healthy.  They don't -- if you think of CPCs the way I think about them is you have really too big components at work.  The innovations that Jonathan talked about, that actually drive CPC up, and then because those products perform better, the ad pressure to be auctioned and therefore drive CPC up.
 Then the two or three components that actually drive them down in the short term actually, it is not as much display, as the places like Brazil and India, they are going very well, so internationally.  Because they don't have as strong an action right now, their CPCs are slightly lower, but they are growing, so that is positive.  Then we already talked about mobile themselves as being lower CPCs.
 These are the two that actually are growing incredibly rapidly in that on the mix in the short term they put a bit of a downward spin on the CPC formula.  But both of them, as we know, they are growing more rapidly, so it is real dollars net in.  And then on top of that, we know there is going to be future pressure on them.  So I'm pretty pleased about the performance of those.
 On the issue of Europe and FX, it is really -- everybody has got a model out there.  We have lived an incredible roller coaster of FX over the last year.  So if you look at currencies like the euro and the pound, they were quite similar on par versus year-over-year, but the last quarter versus this quarter, a huge change.  Then in addition to that, if you look at places like the real in Brazil, the Canadian dollar, the yen, those have quite increased year-over-year.
 So when you do your models relative to FX and [NOI&E], just take in consideration the fact that year-over-year the net net position is -- it has been strengthening all-in.  Quarter-over-quarter it has been going down all-in.  Then on top of that our FX -- our hedging program is really a long-term hedging program.  So this quarter we have reaped $78 million, $79 million of benefits in that.
 So it is a tough puzzle to solve, but just please take the time to look at year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, because it is a puzzle to build.  I hope that answers your question.

Jeetil Patel,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Two questions.  Do you think that Android and mobile represents a bit of a defensive strategy since you pride yourself on the lack of costs in that business as a whole, and at the same time you're adding headcount as a whole in the Company?
 Then second, I guess just curious, the feedback we keep getting in the industry is that the Android infrastructure and support seems to be lower than what, at least your ecosystem would like.  I guess what is the appetite to create other revenue streams outside of advertising, inside let's say mobile in the form of let's say an app marketplace that is pretty vibrant?  Thanks. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - CFO    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     So let me just give the highest level answer is.  The answer is, yes, it is both.  Obviously, having -- we did it for offensive reasons, not defensive of reasons.  We believe that actually open platforms that create the ecosystem where developers can actually create a whole set of new generations of apps is incredibly important.
 And in addition to that, we do know that these new formats, like these smartphones, create an entire new set of activities in which you live, and you will search and you will transact.  So from that perspective I think that it is obviously both.
 I think that -- I take your comment that if the market in general is saying they want more support from us in that space, we are investing heavily because we believe, one, that search advertising, our acquisition of AdMob, by the investments we are making is because for us advertising is completely nascent in this space relative to text search.
 Then second is we, ourselves, are doing a lot of innovation to Cloud Computing and others, actually create a whole new generation of apps ourselves.  So I think that, yes, defensive, yes, offensive, but in the end benefiting everybody.  And I'm glad to hear that you say you want us to invest more in it. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jeetil Patel,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     It seems like your handset vendors are aggressively investing, and we haven't seen it from your side, at least as we talk to some of your partners out there.  I guess it seems like -- do you think that other models outside of advertising need to be explored at this point? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - CFO    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     I'm not sure I understand your question.  Other models such as what? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jeetil Patel,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Well, let's say, consumer applications.  So there are other companies that have created business models around obviously game downloads, other app downloads that are charged.  Obviously you have as well, but it seems like you seem to be -- maybe it is early days, but still early in that development. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - CFO    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     I think you are absolutely right that it is early days.  I think the 70,000 apps that we have is actually a demonstration of the effervescence of that ecosystem that is actually just building now. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jonathan Rosenberg,  Google - SVP, Product Management    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     This is Jonathan.  It is at a very nascent stage.  I think we also -- there's a lot more infrastructure that needs to be built to support a lot of the commerce.  We substantially intend to improve the billing capabilities in the market, and that is obviously one of things that we are investing in pretty aggressively.
 But I don't think of this as defensive at all.  There is a huge opportunity for incremental usage of search, as I talked about earlier.  When we see an opportunity for people searching more, that is obviously something that we want to participate in.
 So we see this platform as winning.  We think that gives us an opportunity to build the mobile Internet.  We think that in the long run that is going to be good for Google; it is going to be good for the applications developers; and it is going to be good for consumers.  So we are investing -- we are investing in building that winning platform.

     I was hoping you could help explain some of the movement in the P&L expenses.  You mentioned that most of the hiring is going into engineering and marketing.  When I look at the sequential increase by dollars from the expenses, you actually had a large increase in G&A, about $48 million sequentially.  And that is compared to only $20 million in sales and marketing.  So can you explain a little bit more -- was there anything in the G&A line that is one-time or not repeatable, or why are they moving like that? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - CFO    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     You have to look at -- there is a couple of things.  One is our recruiting -- if you go year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter we had three big elements.  One is we had -- our recruiting machine that started to build last year was not built in Q2 of last year.  So if you think of the hiring infrastructure and the people infrastructure, has actually been building and now you see the full flow-through.
 We also have had in G&A in general another area -- if you think of everything else as people -- we have talked about legal.  We have had a number of legal costs through this quarter that have also flowed through just because of a number of legal activities that we have taken.  So these are the two biggest components that actually would explain the big variances.

Mark Mahaney,  Citigroup - Analyst    [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Thank you, two questions please.  A year ago you talked about being close to profitability on YouTube, given all the momentum that you have seen over the last year, do you feel like you are a lot closer?  Are you profitable with the YouTube asset?
 Then secondly, when you sell display ads, do you feel like you are selling them to existing search customers or do you think it has opened up a significantly larger customer pool or a mix of those two?  Thank you. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - CFO    [45]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     So let me talk about profitability, but Nikesh will have the answer to your second on display.
 Look, we don't comment on YouTube.  What I can tell you is we are incredibly pleased by its trajectory.  YouTube is -- take a step back -- it is 2 billion views per day in its fifth year of existence.  It is [1 over] a billion monetization videos per week.  It is a huge kind of first page.  And it is aggregating audiences, and you see it today through the top brand advertisers showing up for it.
 So on the World Cup you saw the Sonys and the Cokes -- this is the power of YouTube today.  It is like a worldwide audience.  So in that sense I would argue just read in the tea leaves, it is a great business for us.
 On the display site, Nikesh. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nikesh Arora,  Google - President Global Sales Ops and Business Development.    [46]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Just to add to what Patrick said, to be fair, what display and YouTube has given us, it has allowed us in the case of large search customers to complement the portfolio in terms of being able to offer integrated campaigns, which go all the way from branded sites like YouTube, to networks like the Google display network, and to be able to co-mingle that research.
 Not only that, many advertisers now actually co-mingle that with television ads as well as their print program, so you see a much more integrated campaign capability that begins to happen.
 We've got examples recently, like Patrick mentioned (inaudible), Sony, Volkswagen at the World Cup.  What is interesting is Procter & Gamble has become one of our larger advertisers this quarter.  That is primarily driven by the ability of [CPG] companies to both see the value of search in their ability to build a brand, where they have figured out that people research online and purchase research -- sorry, research online, purchase online.  We call it the ripple effect.
 People like P&G are beginning to see that impact.  Other consumer companies are beginning to see that impact.  In addition to that we are seeing, like Patrick mentioned the Omnicom deal, which we just announced, agencies are beginning to realize that this is an integrated buy.  This is a buy you need to do across multiple properties, not just YouTube, the Google display network and search network, hence the notion of trying to create a trading desk, not just for people like Omnicom, but we have deals in place with publicists and (inaudible), etc.  [et al].

     Can you comment on Android/Chrome as an operating system?  So when we think about Android in and of itself on a mobile device, or particularly like on a cell phone, we can see the revenue opportunity over time with ads basically on apps.  When you think about Android or Chrome as perhaps an operating system for tablets or for computers, is there ever a revenue opportunity in the software, or should we think of it the same way as we think about Android today?  Thanks. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jonathan Rosenberg,  Google - SVP, Product Management    [49]

     Regarding paid clicks, up 15% year-over-year, it has been pretty consistently in the teens for almost two years now.  I was wondering if you could just talk about maybe the top three or four drivers that is keeping that rate at such a robust level for such an extended period of time.  Thank you. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jonathan Rosenberg,  Google - SVP, Product Management    [52]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     This is Jonathan.  I think the biggest thing is just the continued secular shift in advertising from things off-line that are not measurable to the ROI-based model of search advertising, where the advertisers can actually see the benefits in the ROI that they are receiving on the money that they are spending.
 We did see a good bit of that during the recession.  I think there was a disproportionate fraction of budgets that were spent on things where the ROI could be tracked.  I think on our side we are doing a lot in terms of ads quality, as I mentioned in my scripted remarks.  I think the ad format efforts that both Nikesh and I talked about, also served to increasingly drive clicks. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - CFO    [53]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Just to complement this, I think that we have seen, in fact, I would argue, the paid clicks leave quite a bit over the last couple of years in response to the recession.  We have seen that, and we have seen a great recovery in Q1 and Q2 and on a year-over-year basis.
 I think that for us what is really interesting is people are searching.  People are -- secular trends, as Jonathan said, are happening.  And because people are searching, people are clicking.  And the quality of the ad network and the products themselves continue to improve.  We just see the symbiotic relationship happening.

Youssef Squali,  Jefferies - Analyst    [55]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Two quick questions.  I guess for Patrick.  Patrick, as you look at your business needs for the next couple of quarters, do you think that your level of hiring and your level of CapEx, which this quarter had doubled from the prior quarter, is sustainable?  Is that the level you need to get to where you want to get to?
 Second, what are your views on contextual searches that have been implemented by the other search competitors, and which, at least on the surface seems to have you guys losing some marketshare?  Thanks. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - CFO    [56]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     I will let Jonathan talk about conceptual search in detail.  On the issue of marketshare, just to give highest level answer, there's been a lot of debate about people's methodologies from external sources on marketshare.  So I would just -- even the press itself cautioned all these numbers of late.  So I would just put the flag out again to say, just be cautious.  We are very pleased with our results right now in terms of marketshare and -- 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Youssef Squali,  Jefferies - Analyst    [57]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Do you feel you're losing marketshare? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - CFO    [58]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     No.  And the issue that we have is, if you think of -- now I just want to go back to -- because there has been so much noise on this data, I think it is important is to mention it.  If you go back to the fundamentals of hiring and CapEx, CapEx is lumpy.  Here is a perfect example of lumpiness, to be able to work in Scandinavia in the winter is difficult.  As we said, we are building a data center there.  Now it is spring, and we are working there.  So we are also adding machines.
 It just happens that when you get the generations of chips available and everything is available, then you start rolling out.  We had a bit of -- so the lumpiness shouldn't surprise anybody.  And I think that everybody that I had discussions with when we were at $189 million or -- it clearly -- also unsustainably low levels.  So we are running our plans accordingly.  So just stay tuned for CapEx.  But it just happened to be lumpy.
 In terms of hiring, I think it really is the case that we -- I'm going to take a step back to three quarters ago when we said, look, for us the recession is over.  For us we see great products, and we have a mindset of the next half decade and the big platforms we are building that are creating these huge ecosystems.  I mean, for us search is one.  And then mobile and Android, as we just talked about, is one.  Then display is amazing.  It is really growing.  To not put resources to actually fuel this ecosystem, which is the next decade, it is just such an opportunity.  So that is why we are investing aggressively.
 We think it is the right thing to do at the moment in the Company.  And that is the balance we are striving.  Even in Q3, if you think of headcount, we have a lot of people -- sorry, I shouldn't call them kids, but they are people that just graduate from the University, they're going to join us.  So there maybe even be -- you can think of the bump of the accepted, but not started, because they're going to go backpacking for the summer before they come and join us.
 But ultimately we are looking at a trend of continuing to invest.  It is the right thing at this time in the history of the Company.  So that is on CapEx and on hiring.
 And then on conceptual contextual search if there is something that you want -- you would need a more refined answer for, Jonathan, I'm not sure I understand --. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jonathan Rosenberg,  Google - SVP, Product Management    [59]

     I guess I'm not sure exactly what data you're looking or what examples you are referring to. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Youssef Squali,  Jefferies - Analyst    [60]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The two main competitors have adopted some processes that in a way inflate their -- the number of searches that are run on their databases.  You guys don't do it.  I wanted to just know if this is something that you guys may pursue as well or (multiple speakers). 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jonathan Rosenberg,  Google - SVP, Product Management    [61]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Sure, I understand.  Right.  In general we don't comment on the third-party data.  So what you are alluding to are basically the methological problems that have been publicized with respect to auto-roll slideshows that generate.
 Basically if you think about it from a search perspective, it is a spurious request, because it is not really an incremental search.  So the thing that matters to us is ultimately consummating transactions via conversions that we are sending to advertisers.  So what we care about is the number of genuine searches that users are running, where they want to get directly to an answer or a website, or where they are interested in actually clicking on an advertisers' ad.
 It wouldn't help us in any respect, other than in generating counts in share data to cause our -- to cause the total number of searches to artificially go up if there wasn't user intent behind them that was of value to our advertisers.  So the basic answer to your question is no.

     I would like to do delve a little further into some of the growth that you're seeing in the rest of world territories.  Can you talk about how much directionally growth you're seeing out of Asia versus Europe, if that is a breakdown that you're willing to give?  If not, can you talk about which countries are really stand out from a growth perspective on the positive side?  Thank you.

Nikesh Arora,  Google - President Global Sales Ops and Business Development.    [65]

     I would prefer not to talk about regions, because in every region there are countries which do fantastically, there are countries which are challenged.  If you were asking about Greece, I wouldn't have to answer the question.
 So similarly there are countries like Russia, like Brazil, like India, which are growing fantastically for us and continue to show good growth.  It is a combination of more advertisers.  It is a combination of the Internet penetration, getting higher.  It is a combination of people getting savvier, advertisers getting more and more ready for the e-world.
 So we are seeing good growth this quarter.  We saw good growth in Brazil, India, Russia, and we saw great growth.  Then we saw good growth in many other parts of the world.  So even in places like France performed for us wonderfully this quarter.  So even these larger markets, places like Australia and New Zealand performed well for us.

     Actually, I have two questions.  One is, if you look at the sponsored clicks versus CPCs last quarter, paid clicks were up 15%, CPC was up 7%.  Sponsored -- paid clicks remained at that same level, but CPC have come down quite a bit.  I know some of this is mix shift, maybe some of this is FX.  But I guess my question is, is there any competitive dynamics or maybe increasing focus towards organic search or changing user behavior playing any role in terms of some weakness in CPC?  And then I have a follow-up. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jonathan Rosenberg,  Google - SVP, Product Management    [69]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     This is Jonathan.  I think probably the easier way to answer the question is to just give you my quick observations on the things which are clearly driving -- contributing to driving CPCs on average up versus those that are impacting them in the other direction.
 I don't see anything from a user perspective or a share perspective that is obvious that is impacting the overall equation.  I think we are seeing on the positive side conversion rates improving, which is driving CPCs up.  I think your comment about the relative shift in mix to google.com from AFC does contribute positively to CPC.  Google.com is obviously higher, so any mix shift there, everything else being constant, increase CPC.
 The obvious things that we have talked about in the past that push it in the other direction, are emerging markets, Brazil, India -- and Nikesh talked about some of those examples earlier -- mobile, growing in the mix.  And people increasingly looking for longer tail queries that monetize lower to add into their campaigns.  But those are the overall factors.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sandeep Agarwal,  Caris & Company - Analyst    [72]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     So, Patrick, actually the other revenue actually on a [euro] basis is showing visible slowdown versus last quarter.  And you specifically made comments that DoubleClick was very strong.  And then based -- also you have Nexus One, which is contributing second quarter in terms of the incremental revenue source.
 In spite of these things, other revenue was noticeably slower.  So was it because of some kind of slowdown in the (inaudible) enterprise business, or what else is going on there? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - CFO    [73]

     No, in essence it is one word.  It is Nexus One.  So the quarter-over-quarter impact of Nexus One is driving substantially that change.

     A couple of questions.  First on China, I just want to clarify, is it your understanding that the government is okay with your new solutions in terms of your search link on this (inaudible)?  And just any updates on trends in traffic that you're seeing in China.
 Also, just in terms of click-through rates for mobile on sponsored ads, any comparison you can give us there versus how you see click-through rates on PC?  Thank you. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - CFO    [76]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     So I will answer the China, and then I will let Jonathan talk about the click-through rate mobile versus PC.  On China, look, we are basically at the same place when we last discussed, or last time we talked about it, which is we have -- the good news is we have our license renewal.
 But apart from that, certainly from a financial perspective, I just want to reiterate to everybody, revenue from China is not material to our revenue.  And having said that, we had decent revenues for Q2.  So given the sensitivities of everything that is going on with China, I hope you'll understand why I don't want to talk more about it.  But we are working very closely to continue to work through this situation.

Jonathan Rosenberg,  Google - SVP, Product Management    [77]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     On the click-through rate mobile versus PC.  Jonathan, insights? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jonathan Rosenberg,  Google - SVP, Product Management    [78]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     We don't actually break out the relative click-through rates on mobile versus the PC.  I mentioned there are new formats and efforts that we have offered that are starting to increase them, like the click-to-call offering.
 I think the main thing that is really going to fundamentally have to change there, which is the big difference between mobile and desktop, is that today on a mobile phone people are actually less likely to consummate a transaction, because the logistics of entering a credit card or being signed in on a browser is somewhat more time-consuming and onerous.
 So I think that for the mobile system to move very aggressively is going to require more of those commercial transactions actually being taken and placed on the mobile devices.
 On the display side, the AdSense for mobile is actually doing very, very well.  One of the reasons that is doing well is the opposite of what I just stated in terms of effect.  On a mobile device a display ad is something that really gets in your face.  The screen is relatively small, so you see it.  It is unlike a desktop in that you are not typically doing multiple things at once.  So display, I think, is relatively closer to the desktop than is search-based ads.

     I just wanted to -- if you could comment on this Omnicom deal that you have signed, can you talk about what the ramifications are?  What sort of advertisers do you expect will participate?  And any other details would be appreciated. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nikesh Arora,  Google - President Global Sales Ops and Business Development.    [81]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Yes, sure.  You have to understand, as we look at display there are two significant changes that are happening.  One is display buying, which traditionally has been advertising -- advertisers buying sites, is slowly and surely shifting to audience buying.  So I as an advertiser no longer want to buy Tiffany.com or NewYorkTimes.com only.  I want to be able to say, I would like 18-to 35-year-olds who are savvy, who understand technology and who would be interested in my product.
 As you go towards that audience by notion, what advertisers are looking for, is they are looking for specific inventory and specific audiences, whichever site they might be on.  So it becomes even more important for some sort of trading desk type phenomena to exist, where an advertiser can buy across any publisher they would like to buy.
 Now that makes it even more important that you can find some trading desk or trading exchange, where you could have every publisher represented.  Because if you have seven different networks it is suboptimal as an industry to have an advertiser have to go to seven different networks to be able to accumulate audiences with different standards, with different ways those seven different networks look like.
 So effectively the ad agencies which are buying advertising, advertisers would like to have a common platform, which allows them to buy across these entire networks.  That is we are working with Omnicom with, where they believe that if they have the right trading environment set up for the advertisers, it is going to be tremendous value for the advertiser, because advertisers come to a one stop shop and buy across network.  Also, allows a tremendous efficiency, because the bestseller advertiser may not be the best acquirer of a publisher.
 So, therefore, you can separate that in some sort of an Ad Exchange complex, which is what Omnicom is working with us on.  And if you get it right, there is hundreds of millions of dollars at stake in this kind of a deal, because that allows very effective buying across the board on a network, and every player in that ecosystem can get their fair share of the profit.

     Could you talk a little bit about search remarketing?  It seems that you are by far the leader in search, so a lot of disparate writers would need Google for doing this well.  So what kind of growth or traction have you seen for search marketing?  And what is the pricing for this product compared to other display alternatives?  Thank you. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nikesh Arora,  Google - President Global Sales Ops and Business Development.    [84]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     We don't do search remarketing.  We do remarketing on the display side.  We basically are able to go look at what we call interest-based advertising.  We see -- understand that certain users are interested in certain things.  We have based on their having chosen to allow us to use that information, we have the ability to then market to them and show them ads.
 That is way more effective than blindly trying to show advertising to users.  So clearly we are seeing tremendous success in that area.  But that is all we do in terms of [premarketing]. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mayuresh Masurekar,  Kaufman Brothers - Analyst    [85]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     What is the pricing for this compared to other alternatives? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nikesh Arora,  Google - President Global Sales Ops and Business Development.    [86]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The pricing -- look, it is very simple.  The more effective the advertising is, the more likely the advertisers are willing to give more money for it.  So you should expect the more efficient we make advertising, the more relevant it becomes, the more ROI it generates for advertisers, they are willing to complete more aggressively with other advertisers for the same piece of real estate.  So we see that -- we see the effectiveness of that reflected in higher CPCs for that [particular] product.

     Patrick, on the acquisitions this year, what is the philosophy and the financial discipline used to determine the purchase price?  And then separately, was ITA a competitive bid? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - CFO    [89]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     I am not going to comment on the last piece.  What I'm going to say is, look, we have -- there is a real kind of triangulation between three factors in our strategy for acquisitions.  So think of it as talent, intellectual property, and then price.
 So what we are looking for is a sweet spot where, when we find teams of people that are -- have clear leadership.  That, if you think about it, the venture capital world is actually voted by them surviving as long as they have.  And they have, as a team, great talent, engineering talent specifically.
 Then on top of that, put the second piece of it, which is what they have proven that they actually have good intellectual property.  Whether it be -- whatever the app they are working on or whatever, in the case you just mentioned of ITA, a lot of interesting kind of structure of data.
 So the third piece is, obviously, price.  There is a price after which it is not worth it to us.  Then there is a price -- there is a trade-off on price.  What we do is we do -- every one of them, we ask ourselves the question, we look at the intellectual -- and then -- let me put the overarching last bit, which is how does it fit within those four areas that I talked about earlier, which is where we are trying to accelerate our development.
 AdMob is a perfect example of that, where great technology, fantastic team, at the right price, that basically take a huge chunk of what was our engineering roadmap and bring it today, integrate it into the team.
 Then we have much smaller teams, sometimes of 12 to 15 engineers, that have a great piece -- actually on towards another one like that, when you think about the video codecs.
 So it is always a trade-out.  There are many cases where we look at them, and we don't buy them, because we can't find the fit somewhere in those three.  So that is how we think about it.  It is discipline, and we have the debates about them.  Sometimes we (inaudible) and we often say no.  That is how we think about it. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colin Gillis,  BGC Financial - Analyst    [90]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     There are ample deals that you walk away from just because of the purchase price at the end of the day? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - CFO    [91]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Oh, yes, we do. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colin Gillis,  BGC Financial - Analyst    [92]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Jonathan, while I've got you on the line, can you just talk a little bit about -- or help as frame how additive are mobile searches?  Is there a rate of search growth you could share for users across all devices, maybe tied to the same login? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jonathan Rosenberg,  Google - SVP, Product Management    [93]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     I don't actually have any data, but intuitively I think that they are additive, because -- think about it this way, when you're at your desktop, if you have your PC at your desktop and your mobile phone, you're not going to do the search on your mobile phone.  So almost all searches that you are otherwise doing on your desktop, I think you're still going to do in your desktop.
 On the other hand, there are times when you are out with your mobile phone and you didn't have your desktop device.  And obviously, those are by definition incremental, unless of course, in theory you would remember to go back and do that search when you came back to your desktop.
 But I don't think there is much evidence that is the case.  I think the vast majority of them are incremental.  I think they're also slightly different usage patterns across desktop and mobile.  You tend to see more use of the mobile devices on weekends, which is not surprising.  But I don't actually have any more specific data that proves those observations or that hypothesis. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colin Gillis,  BGC Financial - Analyst    [94]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     But I would imagine those curves, including the transaction curves, ultimately bend towards each other over time. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jonathan Rosenberg,  Google - SVP, Product Management    [95]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     I guess I don't understand exactly what you're saying. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colin Gillis,  BGC Financial - Analyst    [96]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Our usage, our mobile usage, and the way we use our mobile, especially as we get more broader band, you have talked about your 4G connections, and our desktop usage.  Ultimately there shouldn't be much difference between the two of them over time. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jonathan Rosenberg,  Google - SVP, Product Management    [97]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Well, I think the mobile usage will grow, and in many ways will be incremental, because you'll be able to do a lot more when you're out in the field.  For example, being able to, within a store, scan a barcode with your smartphone, look at the price on the shelf and determine whether or not you actually would prefer to consummate the transaction through a Web-based alternative, and then automatically complete the transaction, is the kind of thing that is all going to be incremental.  I think as these devices are able to do more of that, people are going to do it.

     Patrick, in looking at YouTube beyond views, it is obvious that the majority of those views still aren't being monetized in a significant way.  What is standing in the way of more monetization of this inventory, which for the most part still seems to be the user generated content side of things?  How significant is it, and does the Viacom ruling change your ability to monetize that inventory? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - CFO    [101]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     I am going to let Nikesh give you the kind of high-level answer, and I will circle back on the Viacom (inaudible). 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nikesh Arora,  Google - President Global Sales Ops and Business Development.    [102]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     I am going to let Patrick talk about the Viacom, But you have to understand first of all, YouTube is five years old, so it is a phenomena that has been created over the last five years.
 We look at YouTube and we monetize it many different ways.  We monetize the homepage of YouTube.  We monetize watch pages on YouTube.  We do promotion videos.  And we are looking at various new ways of looking at how we can put ads into content.
 Now part of the process that has been going on, is we have to continue to free up more and more inventory for it to be available for us to advertise on.  So we have done a lot of these recently where there was [music societies] around the world in various countries around the world, where we are getting permissions to be able to show advertising in those places, which allow us to create more inventory.  So that is the inventory side of things.  We believe we are in a good path to continue to create more and more available inventory.
 In addition, on the inventory side, we have to now keep getting advertisers to start getting -- giving us quality video advertising, which can be put on to YouTube.  My view on this is that we are in the very, very early stages of video advertising.  Because what advertisers do, they will splice a video ad that they have created for television, and they will stick it on YouTube.
 Now if you understand, YouTube allows you two more things, which television does not.  A., it allows you to interact with the ad, which TV does not.  And most of the ads on -- video ads so far are not interactive.  So they expect as that begins to happen, people will start creating more and more interaction.
 The second thing which it allows you to do, it allows you to create some degree of personalization.  The ad your grandmother sees and I see and my daughters see may not necessarily be the same ad for anything.
 So both those features we think will come into play more and more on the advertising side.  So as we get more personalization, more interactivity, as we get more inventory clarified for YouTube, we think that is going to create more monetization opportunities.  And you couple that with the previous conversation on display and the ability to buy audiences, that was just provide the icing on the cake as the thing goes forward. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - CFO    [103]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     So on my side, look, on the issue of Viacom, we are still in appeal, so I don't want to comment on the specifics.  What I can say is two things.  Obviously, with more clarity from this judgment, it gives us more room for experimentation that we didn't have before, because until these rules are clear, you don't know exactly where the bar is.  With that clear bar, we now have much more room for experimentation.
 Then on -- just to comment on if there was ever a great illustration of Nikesh's point a minute ago, just look in the last few weeks about the Old Spice experiment on YouTube.  If you have not tried that, just go on YouTube and check Old Spice, about the interactivity of Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and advertising -- it is just absolutely phenomenal.  So just gives you a glimpse of where the world is going.  And it tells you again about we're just scratching the surface.

     If you break down the components of your display strategy and revenue streams, how would you rank the revenue opportunity of each between YouTube, AdSense, display network and the Ad Exchange in the long term? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - CFO    [109]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     I will net let Nikesh answer it. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nikesh Arora,  Google - President Global Sales Ops and Business Development.    [110]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     I think it is very important to understand that all of these things work to complement each other.  The Ad Exchange allows a buyer to buy across multiple networks.  So without an Ad Exchange, it makes it very inefficient for advertising to be bought, and therefore the pipe is not going to grow as fast now.  So you want to make sure you can create some consistency and standardization in the way display advertising has been bought if you want to take the big TV dollars to start coming into display, as they had been in the early years.
 I think the Google display network is our ability to prove that we can create a network of around -- of multiple publishers and create premium capability for our advertisers to be able to target those publishers.
 Last, but not the least, YouTube becomes our owned and operated properly, property, sort of like us operating google.com and our Google network.  So clearly the margins on our owned and operated properties are higher.  And that allows us to have a premium property in the space.  And it also allows us to accumulate tremendous amount of content, which they can then get offers for advertising.
 So you have to understand, all these three are very relevant to the overall strategy.  I am not trying to prioritize any one ever the other, but clearly, YouTube being able to monetize, bringing more TV dollars into YouTube is fantastic.  Google display network being able to monetize that opportunity across multiple publishers is great.  And without [Addax], which is the glue that will bind all these networks together, it is hard to see that industry growing as fast as we would like to see it grow. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - CFO    [111]

     Let me give -- if you allow me the CFO answer, these are each and every one of them billions of dollars of revenue opportunities.  They are not hundreds of million, they are billions -- the way we think about it in terms of addressable market, this is already a $20 billion industry that is growing very fast.  And so for us, every one of them we (inaudible).  That is why, again, we continue to invest in the total ecosystem.
 Listen, we have had -- so thank you very much for all of your questions.  I want to thank Nikesh and Jonathan again for joining me.  I wish to thank every Googler that is on the call listening to us.  Our engineers, our sales force, our support staff, all these people, I mean, every 90 days we look at our results and we continue to be so pleased.  But it is really the great hard work of all our Googlers.  So from that perspective, I just want to give two thumbs up again to the Googlers for a fantastic job over in Q2.
 With that in mind, I would turn it back over to Connie.  I wish you a great summer, everyone.  And we will talk to you in Q3.  Connie, you can close the call, please.
