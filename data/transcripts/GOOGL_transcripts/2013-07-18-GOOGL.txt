Presentation
Operator    [1]

          Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Google Inc second-quarter 2013 earnings conference call. Today's call is being recorded.
At this time I'd like to turn the call over to Willa Chalmers, Investor Relations Manager. Please, go ahead, ma'am.

Willa Chalmers,  Google Inc - IR Manager    [2]

          Thank you, Jamie. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to today's second-quarter 2013 earnings conference call. With us are Larry Page, Chief Executive Officer; Patrick Pichette, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Nikesh Arora, Senior Vice President and Chief Business Officer.
Also, as you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at investor.google.com. Please refer to our IR website for our earnings releases as well as the supplementary slides that accompany the call. You can also visit our Google+ Investor Relations page for the latest company news and updates so please check it out. This call is also being Webcast from investor.google.com. A replay of the call will be available on our website later today.
Let me quickly go over the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding Google's future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses, and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please note that these forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation. And, we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.
Please refer to our SEC filings for a more detailed description of the risk factors that may affect our results. Please note that certain financial measures that we use on this call, such as operating income and operating margin, are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude charges related to stock-based compensation. We have also adjusted our net cash provided by our operating activities to remove capital expenditures which we refer to as free cash flow. Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Larry.

Larry Page,  Google Inc - CEO    [3]

          Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining our call this afternoon. Google had a great quarter, over $14 billion in revenue, up 19% year on year. Amazing performance for a company that has yet to celebrate its 15th birthday.
We live in a world of abundant computing with multiple operating systems and increasing numbers of devices. It's a very different environment from when Google started. There was essentially one OS and one device category, the PC. These kind of changes don't happen that often; once a decade, maybe even less, actually. But, the shift from laptop to mobiles, from one screen to multiple screens, creates a tremendous opportunity for Google. With more devices, more information, and more activity online than ever, the potential to improve people's lives is immense. Getting you the right information, just when you need it, creating the tools to make everyone more effective at home and at work, and helping you share and remember the moments that matter in life.
That's why I'm so excited about the velocity and execution of our platforms, apps, and devices. First, platforms. With hindsight, Android and Chrome were no-brainers. At the time, they were big bets. The movement across these platforms is tremendous as you saw at our annual IO developer conference in May. I was astounded, we had over 1 million people tuning in live, just to watch our developer keynotes. We've now activated more than 900 million Android devices worldwide and we're lining up over 1.5 million devices every day. That's pretty amazing given that the first Android phone launched less than five years ago.
And, apps usage is increasing fast. Over 50 billion apps have been now downloaded from the Google Play store. And, in fact, we've already paid out more money to Android developers this year than in the whole of 2012.
I love the ability to access your stuff and play anywhere. Take our new music subscription service launched in May. It is an easy fun way to discover new music with all the songs there, ready to go. You never have to think about the device you're using. Chrome, even though only four years old, has over 750 million users worldwide and growing.
The next, apps, Our goal is to design everything so it's beautifully simple and hassle free. Users shouldn't have to need to think about our technology. It should just work. This quarter we completely revamped our maps UI. The map is the screen, no clutter around the edges. There's more information about your surroundings so it's easier to explore. And, we've launched a new, improved navigation feature with notification about incidents before you leave and updates to save time if traffic conditions change. Best of all, this new maps experience is now available on almost all devices you'd be likely to use.
It's the same with Google+. We've done a complete redesign to make use of the entire screen and everything looks consistent, whatever the device or the platform. In addition, the team massively upgraded the photos experience, making software design for professionals automatically available to everyone for free. There's no need for wrinkles anymore.
Take a look on Plus. Many of your photos will now be marked, enhanced and improved automatically. Finally, we launched a new communication app called Hangouts. You can talk to the people you care about across all the major platforms. Video calls from your phone are very cool. Give them a try.
I'm excited about the progress we continue to make with Search. Our Knowledge Graph is now available in 29 languages. And, we've expanded the range of information available. For example, we just added nutrition data. Ask Google how many calories there are in a glass of white wine and you'll find out it's 123, or an avocado, 234 calories. It's good to have the facts if you want to keep healthy. And, we launched Google Now on IOS in April.
In the same way, we want to make everything -- we want to make advertising super simple for customers. Online advertising and developed in very specific, device specific, ways with separate campaigns for desktop and mobile. This made arduous work for advertisers and agencies and meant mobile opportunities often got missed. That's why we launched Enhanced Campaigns. Advertisers have upgraded 6 million campaigns. That's almost 75% of all their active campaigns. And, Nikesh will talk in a little more detail about the positive reaction from clients. This is the biggest ever change to AdWords and the velocity and execution has been great thanks to the hard work of all the teams.
Finally, devices. There's so much excitement around new devices today and the potential for innovation is tremendous. You can now buy the HTC-1 and the Samsung Galaxy X4 with Google Play editions and enjoy the best of Google. There's a ton of momentum around Chromebooks which are growing fast and defying the more general decline in PC sales.
Finally, I know you're all eagerly anticipating what Motorola is launching soon. Having been a customer for a while, I'm really excited. We're very optimistic about the opportunities in front of Google today. The potential for technology to make people's lives better is tremendous.
But, to achieve that potential, we need to stay focused. That's why we continue to invest the vast majority of our resources and time in our core products. My job as CEO is also to think about the future and ensure we continue to bet on new technology that can solve big problems in the world. Project Loon, which we launched in June, is a great example. Bringing affordable balloon powered Internet access to remote areas is an idea that Sergey and I have been thinking about for over a decade. It was great to see that project literally get off the ground and give people a bit more hope for an improving world.
None of this would happen without great people and we are so lucky that we have them. I'd like to thank all the Googlers and Motorolans who make everything possible. Keep up that velocity and execution.
Now, I'll hand the call over to Patrick.

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [4]

          Thank you, Larry and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. So, why don't we dive in by reviewing the details of our overall business financial performance. So, here we go.
Our gross total consolidated revenue grew 19% year-over-year to $14.1 billion. The overall business was up 1% quarter-over-quarter. Google standalone gross revenue grew 20% year-over-year to $13.1 billion and was up 1% quarter-over-quarter. Our Google website revenues was up 18% year-over-year to $8.9 billion, was in fact up 3% quarter-over-quarter.
Our Google Network revenue grew 7% year-over-year to $3.2 billion, and was down 2% quarter-over-quarter. You'll remember the advertising policy decisions we implemented during Q4 and Q1 to ensure that useful and safe user experience continued to have its negative impact on network revenue. Other revenue grew 138% year-over-year to $1 billion, roughly flat quarter-over-quarter. Play store digital sales of apps and content drove the year-on-year and quarter-over-quarter growth. And, it's worth noting that in Q1 we included some seasonal hardware sales due to overflow from Q4, which skewed the Q2 comp somewhat. Finally, please note that, without currency you fluctuations, Google standalone revenue growth would in fact have been 22% year-over-year and 3% quarter-over-quarter.
Turning to Motorola Mobility, gross revenue there was $998 million, just shy of $1 billion. And, it's clear that we've made a lot of progress at Motorola in the past year. And, we are especially excited about the you future of our upcoming product lineup. So, stay tuned.
At Google, our global aggregate paid click growth was strong at 22% year-over-year. In fact, up 4% quarter-over-quarter. Our aggregate cost per click was down 6% year-over-year and down 2% quarter-over-quarter. And, currency fluctuations in this case had a minimal effect in Q2 CPC growth.
And yet, our monetization metrics continue to be impacted by the usual factors that we've discussed many times including geographic mix, channel mix, property mix, our product policy changes, as well as FX. Turning to the geographic performance of Google standalone business, we continue to see a steady performance in the US and Rest of World while the UK was negatively impacted by a warm spring, some FX in their case, and a tough year-over-year comp.
In our earnings slides, which you can find on our Investor Relations website, you'll see that we've broken down our revenue by US, UK, and Rest of World to show the impact of FX and the benefit of our hedging program. So, please refer to those slides for the exact calculation.
US revenue was up 18% year-over-year to $5.9 billion. The UK was up 12% year-over-year, to $1.3 billion which included $24 million of benefits from our hedging program. It is in fact worth noting that in fixed FX terms the UK grew 15% year-over-year. Non-US revenue, excluding UK, accounted for 45% of the total revenue, or $5.9 billion. And, it was up 23% year-over-year which includes $11 million benefits from our hedging program. In fixed FX terms, Rest of World grew a solid 28%.
Coming back to an aggregate level for the total consolidated business, our other cost of revenue was $2.9 billion in Q2, excluding stock-based compensation and Motorola restructuring. Our non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $4.2 billion, also excluding stock based compensation and Motorola restructuring. And, our non-GAAP operating profit was $4 billion in Q2, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin for the consolidated business of 28%. For standalone Google, our traffic acquisition costs were $3 billion, or 25% of total advertising revenue. Other cost of revenue was $2.1 billion, again excluding $110 million of stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $3.8 billion, excluding stock-based compensation of $633 million. And, non-GAAP operating profit was $4.2 billion in Q2, resulting in non-GAAP operating margin of 32% for the standalone Google segment.
Please note that a revaluation of our depreciation policy as it relates to our real estate portfolio resulted in an additional $121 million in Google segment depreciation expenses. About 50% of which represented a one-time charge for assets that are now fully depreciated. With this change in place, depreciation and amortization expense on property, plant, and equipment for standalone Google was $667 million for this quarter.
At Motorola Mobility, total non-GAAP operating expenses, included cost of revenue, were $1.2 billion. Keep in mind, intangible amortization expenses attributed to the standalone Google and Motorola Mobility are in fact included in these non-GAAP measures. Of the $283 million in intangible amortization expense in the quarter, $153 million was the result of the acquisition of Motorola, of which $116 million was allocated to Google and $37 million was allocated to Motorola Mobility. And, as a result, the non-GAAP operating loss for Motorola Mobility was $218 million in Q2, and a non-GAAP operating margin for that segment of minus 22%.
Headcount for the consolidated business was down roughly 9,000 people in Q2. Please keep in mind that consolidated count now excludes Motorola home business. It also reflects the impact of the ongoing mobility restructuring. Standalone Google added about 1,400 people during the quarter. And, in total, the consolidated company ended the quarter with around 44,800 full-time employees.
Our effective tax rate was 24% in Q2. Like in Q1, several one-time items, as well as the continued shift of earnings between domestic and international subsidiaries, impacted our tax rate this quarter. And, also please remember that in Q1 we also had a significant lower rate in that case due to the 2012 R&D credit which was obviously not applied to our Q2 rate.
Let me now turn to cash management. Other income and expense was $247 million for the quarter, which reflects realized gains on investments and interest income, offset by the discontinued -- the continued impact of our FAS 133 expense on our hedging program. For more detail on OI&E, again, please refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR website.
We continue to be very pleased with our operating cash flow which is strong this quarter at $4.7 billion. CapEx for the quarter was $1.6 billion. And, this was versus last quarter at $1.2 billion. Want to remind everybody that the majority of our CapEx spend is related to data center construction, facilities related purchases, and production equipment.
CapEx is just inherently lumpy. And, as I mentioned last quarter during my remarks, our infrastructure will continue to be a strategic area of investment. It's one of the foundations of our future growth. Our free cash flow, again, very strong, $3.1 billion for the quarter.
Larry's comments make it clear that there are just enormous growth opportunities ahead of us as a company. It's in this period of optimism that we continue to fully fund strategic growth opportunities with the same confidence and discipline we demonstrated while growing our mobile business, Android, YouTube, Chrome, just to name a few.
With this, I'll hand it off to Nikesh who will cover more details of our business performance in the quarter. And, after his remarks we'll open up the lines for questions. Nikesh?

Nikesh Arora,  Google Inc - SVP & Chief Business Officer    [5]

          Thank you, Patrick. As Patrick mentioned our businesses had a strong quarter. We had over $13.1 billion in Google standalone gross revenue. Overall, performance was particularly strong in the auto sector, in Brazil, and, as Patrick mentioned, growth in the UK was hampered because of the particularly warm spring.
Before I talk about trends we're seeing and investments we're making in our business, let me call out the effort of our marketing team that continues to create great Google moments. In May, they put on our second annual YouTube Brandcast event in New York for 1,800 advertisers. The event was a great way to show YouTube's unique ability to help marketers connect with highly coveted consumers and ultimately build their brands. At Brandcast, Jeffrey Katzenberg of DreamWorks said YouTube is a whole new entertainment paradigm, and we think he's right.
Also, as Larry mentioned, the team put on another successful Google IO developer conference showcasing our incredible momentum across our platforms to over 6,000 developers in San Francisco with over 1 million people tuning in from around the world. We continue to be pleased with how our business is evolving, growing, and diversifying.
There are three key areas where we continue to make investments. First, our transformation into a marketing platform that works across the connected world Larry described. Second, our systematic move up the marketing funnel to help clients more and more with brand-building campaigns. Third, our investment in our non-ads business such as enterprise services, hardware, and digital content through Google Play.
First, our investments for our constantly connected users. Rapid adoption of new devices means that more people are spending more time online and connected. In fact, new devices and new connectivity means we're moving to a world where people are constantly connected with devices with them all the time. As an example, e-marketers say for the time spent online on mobile devices by US adults grew 273% from 2009 to 2012. From 2011 to 2012 alone, the time spent connected to mobile devices increased by nearly 0.5 hour a day. This means not only are a lot of new services and apps available for users, but also a huge opportunity exists for businesses looking to reach mobile users at the right time and location.
That brings in Enhanced Campaigns. As Larry talked about this, Enhanced Campaigns is a big long-term bet that is designed to help advertisers more easily reach customers across devices with the right message, all within one campaign. We already migrated 6 million of active campaigns to Enhanced Campaigns over the last many months. Our goal is to migrate all of our advertisers and campaigns by the end of this month.
This effort has been executed at breakneck speed and client reaction has been generally positive. We're getting back evidence from clients seeing improved performance using Enhanced Campaigns. For example, Pizza Hut saw their mobile ROI increase by 20%. They found that their mobile click-through rate has increased by more than 60% while their cost per order on smartphones has dropped by 17%.
We believe Enhanced Campaigns does set up our clients and our business really well for the long-term. And, the move towards a constantly connected world goes far beyond just direct response and transactional marketing. People are spending time watching videos, playing games, consuming news, all this creates great new opportunities for brand marketers to engage users. In fact, powered by our TrueView format, YouTube's mobile revenue in June of this year was 3 times what it was at the beginning of the year. To help advertisers reach viewers across more screens, we've opened up our TrueView formats to all of our AdMob network across 1,000s of apps.
Turning our attention to brand marketers, this is a very important area for us where we continue to invest broadly. It's important because the largest global marketers from CPG companies to film studios all conduct large major brand advertising campaigns. Of course, that represents significant budgets that have historically been spent on TV. A great example of this was seen at the Cannes Lions Festival, the Dove Real Beauty Sketches campaign that appeared on YouTube won the Titanium Grand Prix award which is considered the festival's highest honor.
We worked with Burberry to launch Burberry Kisses which allows users to send a message to loved ones sealed with a digital imprint of their real kiss. This campaign runs on YouTube and our display network across desktop, tablet, and mobile. And, last month we began to integrate our recent acquisition, Wildfire, into the double click platform so that brands can now manage the broader customer journey across search, display, mobile, social, rich media, and video. Again, all within one platform.
Finally, I want to talk a little bit about our investment in emerging non-ad businesses. We made a bunch of bets that are beginning to show promise. We're seeing acceleration in new businesses such as hardware, digital content, and enterprise.
First, hardware. We continue to see great momentum across Chromebooks and mobile devices such as our Nexus program. Around the world, Chromebooks are now in more than 6,600 brick and mortar stores, including Walmart and Staples. That's about a 3 time increase this quarter. As Larry said, we've also added two new devices to the Google Play store for Samsung and HTC.
On the digital apps and content front, through Google Play we continue to see tremendous amount of growth in this area. People from over 190 countries now download apps from Google Play every day. More than 50 billion apps have been downloaded so far. In the last year, Google Play digital content, like music and movies, have launched in 21 new countries, including India, Mexico, Russia, with 8 more European countries launching Google Play books this week. Publishers like Penguin, Random House, Time Inc, movie studios like Disney and NBC Universal, and app developers like King and Square Enix are creating carefree experiences for our users. We've also collaborated with all the major record labels to launch a new music subscription service that users seem to be enjoying -- really enjoying a lot.
Lastly, on the enterprise front, that's another great revenue stream for Google. It comprises productivity apps like and Docs and Gmail as well as our Cloud infrastructure. Now more than 50% of the Fortune 500 companies use a paid enterprise product from Google and over 5 million businesses use our productivity apps. This means we have close, long-term relationships with our enterprise customers.
New customers this quarter include some of our world's leading businesses like Federal Express, which has built their store locater in Google maps, Snapchat which runs their application on Google's Cloud infrastructure, and LinkedIn is using Google Search Appliance. New Google Apps customers include Pearson, Keller Williams Realty and the city of Boston. HP is now Google Apps reseller, combining Google software with HP hardware for an initiative to help small businesses call SMB IT in a Box.
To conclude, across our entire business we're investing with enthusiasm and have tremendous opportunities. We strongly believe that we're making the right moves for our users and clients and we're extremely optimistic about the future.
With that, let me hand back to Patrick.

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [6]

          Thank you, Nikesh. Jamie, if you want to give us the instructions, please, to get going on the Q&A, please, I would appreciate it.



Questions and Answers
Operator    [1]

    Thank you.
(Operator Instructions)
Ross Sandler, Deutsche Bank.

Ross Sandler,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [2]

    Great. Thanks, guys. Nikesh, I just had one high level question on Enhanced Campaigns and the transition. Could you give us a little bit more color about the ROIs that most of your customers are seeing?
You mentioned a few comments, but are they going up? And, do you see a significant opportunity in providing conversion tracking across different screens? What do you think will happen with Search budgets if and when you can solve that problem? Thanks.

Nikesh Arora,  Google Inc - SVP & Chief Business Officer    [3]

    Thank you for the question. I think it's fair to say that over the last nine months we've had to do a super herculean task to take millions and millions of campaigns, as Larry mentioned, 6 million campaigns, where we've had to work with our advertising partners to go ahead and convert them towards Enhanced Campaigns.
And, we've had some amazing insights, both working with the advertisers and as well as our teams, as many advertisers have discovered that they were not addressing the mobile opportunity appropriately, they discovered new inventory, they discovered better ROI, and better conversion.
Of course, we anticipate that conversion analytics will work across every screen and be able to be made available to all of our advertisers. We believe that as we get more and more -- as we get better, in terms of being able to provide more targeting and more comprehensive ad solutions for mobility and across all screens, that the ROI should continue to improve.
So, I'm very optimistic in the longer term because we believe mobility provides more context to advertisers in terms of where the users are or where they've been. Which allow for more accurate advertising and advertising which is almost as good as information for them. As that begins to happen, we think the advertising ROI continues to increase. And, hopefully, that means good things for Search budgets.

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [4]

    Thank you, Ross, for your question. Jamie, let's go to the next question.

Operator    [5]

    Ben Schachter, Macquarie.

Ben Schachter,  Macquarie Research - Analyst    [6]

    One question for Larry and one for Patrick. Larry, when you think about hardware, are there other hardware categories beyond just phones and tablets where you believe Google can potentially build meaningful businesses? And then, Patrick, in Q1 we didn't really see the usual uptick in expenses that you see annually.
But then, now we do see it in Q2. It sounds like some of that was the accounting issue around depreciation. Can you help us understand what happened there more? Thanks.

Larry Page,  Google Inc - CEO    [7]

    Thanks, Ben, for the question. I think we've been an early innovator in smartphones and we've been really excited about starting Android when no one really thought it was going to be interesting. And, I think it's always a mistake to assume that technology will be static. So, I think certainly over the long term, we're going to have new kinds of devices and ways of interacting with computing and the Internet.
We're obviously excited about Google Glass and new ways of interacting with hardware and new types of hardware. With any technological change you probably overestimate the short-term and underestimate the long-term. So, I think our -- we're really excited about making those investments and making sure we're positioned to the future. That's why I love using Glass because I feel like every time I'm using Glass I'm living that future, that's really, really exciting to me.

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [8]

    Why don't I jump on the next question. So, on the issue of expenses, look, our expenses in Q2 were completely in line with the objectives we had set for ourselves. In general, we continue to exercise financial discipline and monitor our product profitability. But, it's on that basis that we recognize the significant opportunities that are ahead of us.
And, with the view to the long-term, we continue to invest significantly and intelligently to fuel these opportunities. The fundamental issue is, as I said a number of times on previous calls, if you want to hire X amount of people, you have a target for the quarter or for the year.
They come in sometimes a bit over, sometimes a bit under. But, the real question is are you still on the right trajectory for the long-term you're shooting for. That's really the issue between Q1 and Q2, Ben. Thank you for your question. Why don't we go to the next question, Jamie?

Operator    [9]

    Mark Mahaney, RBC Capital Markets.

Mark Mahaney,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [10]

    Great. Two questions, please. First, on CPC, Patrick, you mentioned a couple of factors behind the deflation there. I don't think you ticked off mobile. I don't know if there's any particular reason why you didn't or maybe I missed it.
In terms of the employee adds, maybe a question for Larry, as you think about where you've been able to get employees, the ease or the difficulty with which you've been able to hire the employees you wanted to hire, can you comment how that has changed if at all over the last year or two? Thank you.

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [11]

    Why don't I jump in on the first one. Clearly, mobile has some effect in it, and we've talked about that in the past. It's one of the many factors that are at work. I just gave the list, and the property mix, obviously, and the channel mix includes a bunch of mobile shifts as well in there. That's part of the equation clearly for sure that drives both sides of the equation.
I just want to remind everybody that it's always dangerous to just look at CPCs by themselves or just look at paid clicks by themselves. But, in fact it's a combination of the two that gives you the health of the business. And, these mixes move all over the place, depending on the number of changes going on in any quarter. But, overall, very pleased with the overall performance. On headcount, I'll led it to Larry to jump in.

Larry Page,  Google Inc - CEO    [12]

    Yes, Mark, I think -- I don't think we've seen any significant change in the short-term on hiring. I think we're really lucky that we have really great people at the company and more great people who want to work with us. We've been able to buy small companies too where you get great people. And, I don't see any major changes in how that's been changing.
I also think retention for the company has been great. People are excited to work here. They're excited to work on important things and make the world better. And, we're able to hire some of the best people in the world. I think that's been continuing and it's pretty stable.

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [13]

    Thank you for the question, Mark. Jamie, let's go to the next question, please.

Operator    [14]

    Carlos Kirjner, Sanford Bernstein.

Carlos Kirjner,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. - Analyst    [15]

    Thank you, two questions. Larry, I think you sometimes say that technology has done only 1% of what it can do, suggesting that there's a lot of opportunity for Google. If that's the case, why isn't your R&D budget 10%, 20% or materially higher than today?
Or in other words, what limits your ability to spend more to capture these opportunities? Secondly, Patrick, can you tell us in general what specific financial operating metrics you use to evaluate the success of Google Fiber as a business? Thank you.

Larry Page,  Google Inc - CEO    [16]

    Yes, that's a really great question, Carlos. I think that's our main job is to figure out you how to obviously invest more to achieve greater outcomes for the world, for the company and so on. And, I think those opportunities are clearly there as we've seen in the past with things like Chrome and Android, and I've talked about that a lot.
I think that execution of velocity, I've talked about it a lot too. It's pretty easy to come up with ideas. It's pretty hard to make them real and get them to billions of people. That's what's for me is so exciting about being a company who, like Google, is that we get to do technological innovation at scale and get it out to -- on the scale of the whole world, to billions of people. But, I wish we could just snap our fingers and accomplish that.
It's actually a lot of hard work and takes a lot of great people working really hard to make that happen. And, we're working every day to improve our processes, improve our leadership, improve how we're organized and to make that all go faster.
That's why I come into work excited every day. And, I think everyone else does too. I wish we could snap our fingers and just do a tremendous amount more instantly. But, the reality is it's hard work to scale and that's what we do.

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [17]

    Carlos, I'll take the second one related to Google Fiber. Just as a context for everybody, we have been on the public record to say we're running Google Fiber and excited about it and we always had profitability as one of the key criteria for this opportunity. And, in terms of metrics, they should be just aligned with any sound business that's in that domain of access which is a combination -- but first, actually, it was interesting because the question was how successful was it going to be, the product.
And then -- meaning how many people would want to take it. And then, the second -- so, we've been obviously very pleased by our results in Kansas City and now the announcements of the other two cities we've made since then. And then, there's all the regular metrics you can imagine which have to do with cost of infrastructures, cost to serve and then how they flow into a profitability model.
There's no real rocket science in the financials of it. The real magic occurs with the definition of the product, the innovation on the technology that the teams are pushing, and what makes Google Fiber 100 times faster than the next best thing. That's really what we're really focused on. So, I hope that answers your question. And, let's go to the next question, Jamie.

Operator    [18]

    Doug Anmuth, JPMorgan.

Doug Anmuth,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [19]

    Great, thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask about the network sites deceleration that you saw, a 12% growth last quarter and 7% growth this quarter. If you could just talk about some of the key drivers there and perhaps how much is self-inflicted as you're cleaning up more of the sites and quality and everything?
Secondly, can you talk about the key drivers that you see in terms of improving conversion rates for mobile ads? I know you mentioned the conversion analytics. What else do you think gets mobile ad conversion up over the next few years? Thank you.

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [20]

    For the first part -- I'll answer the first part of the question, Jamie -- and then -- sorry, Doug, and then, Nikesh will answer the second part. Clearly, the network deceleration, we've -- that's why we made the comment last quarter about the DLA and the policies. And, it's clearly having an impact as now we've had a number of partners that have, through Q1 and Q2, have all been notified and made the changes to their behavior.
So, these policies are now coming into compliance and as a result of it, you see the impact. But, we really believe that this is a really good thing for our users. And, in the long term will really benefit both the users and Google. That's the core elements of what's going on there. And then, for the second question, I'll let Nikesh jump in.

Nikesh Arora,  Google Inc - SVP & Chief Business Officer    [21]

    Yes, thank you, Patrick. I think it's important to understand, as I said, that improving conversion rates for us requires us to do a lot of things. One is we have to understand the cross-device behavior better. We have to understand the cross-device conversion people. People can start a search on one device and conclude it on another device.
These opportunities did not exist in the past when we were all focused on one screen. In addition to that, as we talk about mobility, we start to understand the context of the users a lot better. As I said, where are they, where have they been, what could their search possibly mean?
When they're searching -- in a car parking lot and searching for another car dealership, that gives us a very different signal than if you're sitting at your desk and searching for a car. All those attributes, all those factors need to go in, into creating better targeting, better advertising for our end users so that that actually helps increase ROI for advertisers and hopefully ROI for us in the longer term.

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [22]

    Thanks for your question, Doug. Jamie, let's go to our next question, please.

Operator    [23]

    Scott Devitt, Morgan Stanley.

Scott Devitt,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [24]

    Hi, I had two questions. First, Larry mentioned some of the new features in the maps update. I think also the Gmail tab update seems like it's being pushed to users you now. It would be great to know -- if you could share the time line just for the full roll-out for the US and internationally, any implications you foresee the update may have on those that are relying on marketing as a distribution channel?
And then, secondly, Larry also spoke about balloon deployed Internet access. I was wondering if you could talk about another initiative that seems like it has significant opportunity long-term, the automated vehicle opportunity? And, when you think of that as a commercial opportunity at scale. Thanks.

Larry Page,  Google Inc - CEO    [25]

    Yes, thanks for the questions, Scott. I think -- I'm not sure the detail of the Gmail roll-out. I think -- I've been excited to use it and I think it's a really great experience. I think we're doing a lot to improve people's experience on Gmail. I mentioned we have a huge number of users on Gmail. It's growing quickly. We're really, really excited about it.
And, obviously there's some things around the e-mail experience that can be improved and we're doing a lot to organize commercial offers and things like that, make sure that they're -- you're not getting overwhelmed by spam and so on. I think those have been great, very user positive features that we're rolling out.
I think in terms of automated cars, I think, again, that's a very early stage thing. I think we're very excited about it. I think it has potential again to have tremendous impact on people's lives on mobility and so on. And, I think there's nothing that's changed about that. We're super excited about it, we're working hard, It's very early stage project, obviously.
Then there's the last part of your question, I mean, I think it's hard to predict exactly when these things will be commercial. My question I always ask is why aren't you doing it today? So, we try to reduce whatever roadblocks that we can to getting things out as quickly as possible. And, I think -- I think there's great opportunity there.

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [26]

    Thank you for your questions, Scott. Jamie, let's go to our next question, please.

Operator    [27]

    Anthony DiClemente, Barclays.

Anthony DiClemente,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [28]

    Hi, thanks. I have one for Patrick and one for Larry. Patrick, just want to ask about CapEx. I think you mentioned in your comments that data centers and other network infrastructure was lumpy and responsible for the doubling of CapEx.
I'm just wondering, I'm not sure from an accounting perspective what the useful life is on some of those investments? And, whether or not the amortization of those assets is part of what's causing a little bit of the uplift in operating expenses? Would love to hear a little more about CapEx.
Larry, as Google continues to invest for future growth, I just wanted to ask how do you, as a leader of the company, ensure that the people at Google and your employees keep the small entrepreneurial culture that Google had and was known for in its earlier days? Thanks a lot for the question.

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [29]

    Let me jump in, Anthony, on the first part and then I'll let Larry answer the second. We don't give the details of the different categories of depreciation for our assets. But, you can imagine that as we build these -- the data centers and the computers, clearly data centers have a long lifetime.
Because if you think of them as land, electricity, power, building shells, cooling towers, all that technology has much longer useful life. The computers themselves, the machines, the servers have a much shorter lifetime. And, we track all these by categories, obviously.
And, clearly there's a relationship between that and our depreciation rates that have been -- between that and that have been climbing over the last few quarters. There's nothing magical about it as well. It's just basically what you would expect by category. On the second question, I'll let Larry answer.

Larry Page,  Google Inc - CEO    [30]

    Yes, it's a great question, I think. I think I'm very, very excited to see -- I mentioned the Project Loon or the automated cars. I think a lot of it is making sure that our employees and Google as a company has permission to do important things. And, those things always start with a small group of people. They start with 1 or 2 people, then 10 people and so on, and those people can get a lot of things done.
So, I think partly I measure the health of the company in that way is we're able to start up new and important things and make traction on them. And, that's the only way we end up with things like Android and Chrome, those kind of projects. So, I look at it as a portfolio thing.
There's some number of people that like to work on really crazy things that are going to really change the world. And, want to deal with 10 other friends and work hard on them and make sure we're creating those opportunities and growing them into things that become Gmail or Android or Chrome or things like that. So, I look at it across the portfolio and I think we're doing quite well and I'm pretty excited about it.

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [31]

    Thank you for your question, Anthony. Jamie, let's go to our next question, please.

Operator    [32]

    Mark May, Citi.

Mark May,  Citigroup - Analyst    [33]

    Thanks for taking my questions. The first one, I'm wondering, there was an expectation, I think, starting this quarter that we'd start to see some of the impact of Enhanced Campaigns. And, obviously, you're seeing great adoption of that. And, that that adoption and the impact that that might have on blended prices might offset these mix factors that you referenced.
I wonder if you could help walk us through why that wasn't the case necessarily in this quarter? And then, secondly, probably for Patrick, I wonder can you help estimate the impact on the network growth in the quarter from the quality improvement initiatives? And, are these issues that might impact future quarters or was this mainly a first half of this year impact?

Larry Page,  Google Inc - CEO    [34]

    Yes, that's a great question. I'll just say maybe one sentence, then turn it over to the other guys. I think it's important to keep in mind Enhanced Campaigns the largest change we made in AdWords, ever. It was done pretty quickly. So, I think we're still very, very early stages of that.
We changed tremendous amounts for how our teams operate, how our advertisers operate, how everyone buys those ads, what the users see. And, we've done it pretty well. It's been pretty smooth, which I'm really excited about. But, like I said, that's the early stages of a very, very major change. I think we're very pleased with how that's going.

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [35]

    Yes, very much so. And so, on the second part of your question, Mark, I think the quality, the force for quality around our policies, they will take a year to flow through. Once you reset the bar, then it actually -- by the time -- people will adhere to these changes but then you have to actually navigate through the entire year-over-year effect which will probably take a couple more quarters.
That's just a timing issue. Having said that, I just want to remind everybody, again, that the fundamental issue that we see is it's really important for us to actually have a great user experience. And, Susan and her teams pounded this by making changes on a constant basis to make sure that at the end of the day there is that smart about the quality of the user experience, and the quality of the ads.
Because in the end that's what really drives the benefit in the long term. So, when we have to hit -- take some hits in the short term in order to get the right answer in the long-term for our users and our advertisers, we're always ready to them. And, that's a great example it. We're actually not too worried about it.
We have so many other areas that -- we've just talked about Enhanced Campaigns. There's PLAs. There's so many other areas that offers us opportunities that we just got to keep this in balance. Thank you for your question, Mark. Jamie, let's go to our next question, please.

Operator    [36]

    Heather Bellini, Goldman Sachs.

Heather Bellini,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [37]

    Great. Thank you very much for the question. I just wanted to follow up on Enhanced Campaigns. I guess one of the questions people are trying to get at is was there any impact from Enhanced Campaigns on paid clicks and CPCs in the quarter that you could try and help us calibrate?
And then, I guess the other question would be given obviously it is still new and broad roll-out this quarter, how many quarters do you think this needs to be in place for you to have a good sense of the impact it might have on those metrics? And then, sorry, then my last question was anything related to the impact on FX related to CPCs? I didn't think I heard that. Thank you.

Nikesh Arora,  Google Inc - SVP & Chief Business Officer    [38]

    Hi, Heather, this is Nikesh. Thank you for your question. I think -- let me step back and say first of all, it's, as Larry mentioned and Patrick mentioned, it is an existential requirement for us to take our advertisers and move them to a campaign strategy which allows us to move them across multiple screens.
This wasn't something that is just a remedy imperative. It's an imperative from a simplicity perspective, from an advertiser return perspective, and also from the way our teams operate. We have spent the last six months migrating over 6 million campaigns, as I mentioned. We'll probably be done by the end of this month which is not too far away.
And, as you can imagine, that we've been focusing and moving these things across the board. So, we're still looking at the full impact since the impact has graduated over the last few months. Now, in terms of what the impacts of this should be in the longer term, as I mentioned earlier, the impact in the longer term should be that we should be able to provide, simpler, faster, better ads to our advertisers across multiple screens.
In terms of when you should be able to see effects of these things, obviously there are effects that we see and we monitor and we take a look at, but it's too early for us to go out and start detailing what the impact of these things are. Of course, in the long-term it should have a positive impact on conversions and, as a result, all resulting metrics that affect conversion.

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [39]

    Heather, I'll just jump on your very last question about FX related to CPCs. As I said in my comments, there's actually a marginal effect. FX was not a big factor this quarter. It has been a little bit for the UK, as I mentioned, but for the rest of our -- the world, it has not been a major impact for the CPC issue. Thank you for your questions, Heather. Jamie, let's go to our next question, please.

Operator    [40]

    Justin Post, Merrill Lynch.

Justin Post,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [41]

    Great, thank you. Patrick, the gross profit growth has been trailing revenue growth, I think it was about 14% this quarter, for about three quarters especially. Can you talk about what really drove the step-down last year in 3Q?
And, is there any way to see that gap close? And, do you use gross profit as a measure or do you look more at revenue growth? Just some of the drivers of the difference would be really helpful. Thank you.

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [42]

    Thanks, Justin. Again, a topic that's for financial analysts have been always top of mind. I just want to reiterate some of the basic messages that have not changed in how we think about this. First of all, we care about revenue growth we care about profitability. We care about both.
And, as I said before, we're not in a business to lose money or cross subsidize or any of these things. Regarding margins, we really look at every incremental profit $1 that creates shareholder value. And, really focused on these profit dollars rather than the percentage margins.
Many of the new opportunities that we may be exploring, whether it be hardware, whether it be play, whether it be -- many of these will have different margins in our core business. But, they actually offer great huge revenue pools, huge margin pools in absolute dollars.
And then, create much shareholder value and, in many cases, with Larry and the product area leads, great synergistic value between the products to create these great experiences. That's basically the mindset that we apply at it. And, we track them independently and together and make sure that we actually deliver continued revenue growth and profit growth. So, that's the mindset at which we apply.
And, don't read in my comment that we're not focused on our core business. It remains our core business. The core is the core is the core and it continues to give us both revenue and oxygen profit to fuel our growth as well. So, that's the balanced answer to your question.

Justin Post,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [43]

    If I could follow up?

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [44]

    Yes, yes.

Justin Post,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [45]

    Is there anything in there that may be operating right now at negative gross margins that is intransitory in nature?

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [46]

    I wouldn't comment on a specific product by product. But, it's clear that if there are timing issues, if there's a product that is actually in investment mode and at the beginning of its investment curve, you know that you're actually investing in it for the timing of future profit. We do that too.
You can imagine our very first customer in Kansas City, right, the P&L for that day was negative. But, that's not why we did Kansas City. We did Kansas City because we knew as a city it was going to be very profitable.
So, there's clearly products that have, because of the timing investment moments that actually show, will show, negative. But, not because we want them to be negative, just because of where they are in their investment phase. So, that's how we think about it. Thank you for your question. Jamie, let's go to the next question, please.

Operator    [47]

    Brian Pitz, Jefferies.

Brian Pitz,  Jefferies & Company - Analyst    [48]

    Thanks. Nikesh, you briefly mentioned PLAs. We continue to see that format in Search and recently we noticed integrated deals and offers into that format. Any additional color on the impact from PLAs in the quarter? Larry, regarding product search, I guess more broadly, do you think users will be able to purchase items without ever leaving the search results page at some point? Thanks, so much.

Larry Page,  Google Inc - CEO    [49]

    Thanks, Brian. I'll take the second question first. I think to the extent, obviously, we can streamline your process of doing transactions or fulfilling any task, that's a good thing.
I think in the trial we're doing in the Bay area with same day delivery you can buy things very easily and get them delivered in a couple hours, which is a pretty great experience. We definitely look at any ways we can find to really improve our user's experience. Nikesh, do you want to take over the PLA parts?

Nikesh Arora,  Google Inc - SVP & Chief Business Officer    [50]

    Yes, as Larry mentioned we're trying to get the user experience to be better and better. And, as we've talked in the past, things are moving from tend to a link to entity level search where people are searching for specific entities and they expect response as a specific entity when doing that search.
You think about PLA in the broader context, when people search for something they like to get their answer. If it's a product they're searching for, of course, PLA satisfies that requirement. We are signing up tens of thousands of merchants who want to share that data with us, who want to make that data visible as part of Google Search. We think this is a good thing.
Again, as we provide more and more PLA information, obviously, it has an impact on people's clicking of those links. So, the long-term that should have a positive impact on click-throughs on various ad formats. But, for now, it's too early to talk about the impact of those on the overall numbers that we have.

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [51]

    Thank you for your question, Brian. Jamie, let's go to our next question. We have time for a couple more.

Operator    [52]

    Gene Munster, Piper Jaffray.

Gene Munster,  Piper Jaffray & Co. - Analyst    [53]

    Good afternoon. Question on the Motorola X phone, I know you haven't said a ton about it, but there has been some talk that you're going to be aggressively marketing this.
Can you just talk a little about this relationship you have between having the Motorola X phone be enough of a success that you make a statement but not enough of a success that you end up corrupting or impacting your Android partners? So, talk about that relationship. Thanks.

Larry Page,  Google Inc - CEO    [54]

    Thanks for the question, Gene. I think nothing about what we said has changed. We operate Motorola independently. You can see the level of work that's gone on there to operate that business.
I think the team's been doing a great job, as we mentioned. I think they're working hard on making great products and I think we're real excited about it. I think they're excited about it. And, obviously, you'll get to try it out pretty soon.

Gene Munster,  Piper Jaffray & Co. - Analyst    [55]

    Do you feel that the incremental investment, is it going to be -- it's been rumored to be $500 million. Is it something in that range?

Larry Page,  Google Inc - CEO    [56]

    Are you talking about -- I guess people have been speculating about marketing and so on. I think that, obviously, we're going to -- we're operating Motorola independently. We're running it much the same way you would run any business like that. And, I think we're doing things that are normal for that business. I think probably too much has been made over those things.

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [57]

    Thank you, Gene, for your question. Okay, we have time for one more question. So, Jamie, can you give us the last question.

Operator    [58]

    Thank you. Richard Kramer, Arete Research.

Richard Kramer,  Arete Research - Analyst    [59]

    Thanks, very much. One for Larry and one for Patrick. For Larry, given the recent launch of YouTube subscriptions and then also music services, how widely do you see Google expanding into subscription based services in the future?
Do you see this in three to five years as something that would be a meaningfully-sized segment that would rival network in size, for example? For Patrick, since you've had questions about Motorola, being excited about it is nice but the business has lost nearly $1 billion on a GAAP basis in the last three quarters.
So, can you give us some sort of time scale for achieving returns here? And, I know you mentioned you're just looking for absolute profit dollars. But, what's the ultimate gain for Motorola in terms of contributing to Google's profit base or even just to distribute more widely Google services? Thanks.

Larry Page,  Google Inc - CEO    [60]

    Yes, the question about subscription services, I think, like we said, we're really excited about the play music subscription being really well received. I love using it. I think we're always looking for ways to meet our users' needs better. And, obviously subscriptions are one way to do that.
So, I'm sure over time we'll try to meet our users' needs better and have our products in that area. I don't have anything to announce at this time there. On the Motorola question, Patrick, you want to take that?

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [61]

    Sure. I think the Motorola question has to be put into context of two things. One is what we originally paid for Motorola and all the assets we acquired and the benefits we got out of that acquisition because there wasn't only a short-term financial play, there was a number of strategic issues. We're very pleased with the divestiture of the home business which generated quite a bit of cash over the last -- in Q2.
I think you have to put this conversation in the context of the entire acquisition for which we're really pleased. And, we also are incredibly proud of what the team has accomplished in the last year in having now created this great entity under Dennis who is now lean and mean with 5,000 employees focused on the future and really pounding away on the next generation of products.
I'll leave it to the coming quarters to really demonstrate the new Motorola that's showing up. And, you'll see that in the coming weeks, actually. Larry, any last comments before we close?

Larry Page,  Google Inc - CEO    [62]

    No, I want to thank everyone for spending so much time with us today. And, we will see you all next quarter.

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [63]

    Jamie, I'll let you close the call. Thank you, everybody, for your time.

Operator    [64]

    Thank you, sir. Again, we do thank everyone for their participation. That does conclude today's conference. Please, have a good day.
