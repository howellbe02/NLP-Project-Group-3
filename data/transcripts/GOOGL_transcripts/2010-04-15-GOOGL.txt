Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

           Good day and welcome to the Google Inc.  conference call.  Today's call is being recorded.  At this time I would like to turn the call over to Ms.  Maria Shim, Investor Relations.  Please go ahead, ma'am. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maria Shim,  Google - IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

           Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to today's first-quarter 2010 earnings conference call.  With us are Patrick Pichette, Chief Financial Officer; Jeff Huber, Senior Vice President of Engineering; Susan Wojcicki, Vice President of Product Management, and Nikesh Arora, President, Global Sales Operations and Business Development.
 Also, as you know, we are now distributing our earnings release exclusively through our newly revamped Investor Relations website located at investor.google.com.  So going forward please refer to our IR website for our earnings releases, as well as supplementary slides that accompany the call.  This call today is also being webcast from investor.google.com.  A replay of this call will also be available on our website in a few hours.
 Now let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor.  Some of the statements we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding investments in our innovation agenda, expected performance of our business, and our expected level of capital expenditures.  These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially and reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation.  We undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.
 Please refer to our SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K, for the year ended December 31, 2009, as well as our earnings press release for a more detailed description of the risk factors that may affect our results.  Copies can be obtained from the SEC or by visiting investor.google.com.
 In addition, certain financial measures we use on this call such as operating profit and operating margin are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude charges related to stock-based compensation.  We have also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capital expenditures, which we refer to as free cash flow.  Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations can be found in our earnings press release.
 Now with that, I will now turn the call over to Patrick. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP & CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

           Thank you, Maria.  Good afternoon, everyone.  It is Patrick Pichette speaking.  Thank you for joining us.
 Starting the new year provides us with a great opportunity to tune and streamline our quarterly earnings communications.  So, as a result, we have today for you a new format for the call.
 First, the two calls we had last year will be merged into a single call going forward and a slightly longer for the Q&A.  Second, Eric will not be joining us going forward, so I will be leading the call.
 In the new format, Jonathan Rosenberg and I will review the quarter with prepared remarks, and then Nikesh Arora, our head of Global Sales and Operations, will be joining us for Q&A.  Unfortunately today Jonathan could not be with us, but, however, what we have is Jeff Huber, our Senior Vice President of Engineering for Apps, and Susan Wojcicki, our Vice President for Advertising Products, sitting in for Jonathan.
 So here we go.  Let me start by giving you some high-level thoughts about our situation at Google before I go into the details of our Q1 performance.  As we enter 2010, it is really clear that the digital economy, it continues to grow rapidly, and at Google our users and advertisers all continue to benefit from this profound and positive trend.
 Our Q1 results are simply a reflection of these trends, and this really fuels our optimism as we continue to invest in innovation for the long run.  Consequently we are continuing to invest heavily in people, products and acquisitions.  So you see this already in our results for Q1.  On people we have already stepped up hiring, which is evident obviously with the numbers we presented, and we expect to continue hiring aggressively through the year.  We have a strong pipeline of candidates primarily focused on engineering and sales, and we are on-boarding them to fuel our growth agenda as fast as possible.
 On product we continue really to push the envelope on two fronts.  First, we're intensely focused on user experience.  Our continued success really depends on delighting users with differentiated products that really inspire.  Think of Google Goggles, for example.
 Second, we are continuing to improve our ads business to show the right ad in the right format to the right person at the right time, all this regardless of device.  Susan and Jeff will really cover each in the coming minutes both of these sections.
 Finally, acquisitions.  We have been very active so far this year, and we have a strong M&A pipeline in place.  It is really designed to build on our existing focus areas and to bring new talent and new technology to Google, feeding our entrepreneurial spirit.  It really matters to us.
 So in sum, we continue to be incredibly excited by the opportunities in front of us, and in consequence we should expect to see continued investment in each of these areas.
 On the business front, Q1 was really a strong quarter.  The healthy momentum from Q4 and the general economic recovery has simply continued, resulting in a very positive start to the new year for us.  Large advertisers have come back in force versus last year, reflecting really an improved economy and a few really key important trends.
 So, for example, it is clear now that our offerings are much broader in scope, and by this I mean they offer highly measurable but also integrated campaigns across search, display and mobile.  As a result, our conversation with advertisers are becoming more and more strategic because of this integration, and you can see this in our results and our performance.
 By this I mean we performed well across every major product area, including search, display, mobile and enterprise in Q1, running on all cylinders.  For search google.com was very strong.  Great performance across all geographies and all major verticals, including retail, travel, local, technology and finance.
 Growth in display was also really strong.  Q4 momentum continued across all regions, products and channels.  The Google content network was strong, driven by increased demand in consumer package goods and entertainment.  The Ad Exchange is also gaining great traction as we move all buyers and sellers into the latest version of the platform.  And finally, we saw very impressive growth on YouTube with several exciting new content deals signed.
 Mobile, the third axis, another great, very important area for Google, is also growing very nicely, benefiting from both a continued growth in the smartphone volumes and Internet users and usage on the iHand mobile devices.
 Finally, enterprise recently launched a host of successful integrations, including a large deployment at, for example, KLM, just one example among many.  All this great performance is reflected in our financial results and our trajectories.
 So I will now, if you will allow me, go through our results quickly.
 So financially gross revenue grew 23% year-over-year to $6.8 billion.  Google website's revenue grew up 20% year-over-year to $4.4 billion with strength, as I mentioned, across all major geographies and verticals.  Our AdSense revenue was up 24% year-over-year to $2 billion, reflecting again a continuous strength in the Google content network, an important part of our display business.
 Other revenue was also up 68% year-over-year to $300 million, and that includes the revenue from the sales of our Nexus One product.  Global aggregate paid click growth remained healthy, up 15% year-over-year and up 5% quarter over quarter.  Aggregate cost per click growth was up 7% year-over-year but down 4% quarter over quarter.
 You should know that FX had a positive impact on the year-over-year on CPC growth and also a negative impact quarter-over-quarter.  A lot of movement in FX year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter.  Remember, too, that this is an aggregate number, which includes both google.com but also the AdSense properties.
 Turning to our geographic performance, revenue from the US was up 22% year-over-year to $3.2 billion.  In our earnings slides, which you will find on our Investor Relations website, you will see that we have broken down our revenue by US, UK and rest of world to show the impact of FX and the benefits from our hedging programs.  So please refer to those slides for the exact calculations.
 International revenue accounted for 53% of our total revenue or $3.6 billion, up 24% year-over-year, which includes $10 million in benefits from our hedging programs, and this is a big difference compared to $154 million of benefits in Q1 of last year.  Using fixed exchange rates, our international revenue would have been roughly $242 million lower year-over-year.  Finally, the UK was up 15% year-over-year to $842 million.  So very strong performance right across the board on the revenue.
 Let me turn to expenses for a moment.  Traffic acquisition costs were $1.7 billion or 26% of total advertising revenue.  The other cost of revenue was $741 million, including stock-based compensation of $6 million, which also expenses related to the sale of Nexus One.
 Finally, all operating expenses totaled $1.8 billion, including approximately $285 million of stock-based compensation.  The increase year-over-year in OpEx was primarily due to increases in payroll and advertising and promotion expense.  As a result of all this, our non-GAAP operating profit, which does exclude stock-based compensation, increased to $2.8 billion in Q1, resulting in non-GAAP operating margin of 41% up approximately 180 basis points year-over-year.  Headcount was up 800 approximately versus Q4 of last year, ending the quarter with approximately 20,600 full-time employees.
 Finally, our effective tax rate 22% for Q1.
 For a minute let me turn to cash management.  Other income and expenses was $18 million for Q1, which includes great progress in our portfolio management performance, but also largely offset by the timing and accounting impact of hedging expenses associated with the FASB 133.  For more detail on OI&E, again please refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR website.
 So all of this turns out into operating cash flow, which was very strong at $2.6 billion.  CapEx for the quarter $239 million, again primarily related to our data center operations.  As a reminder, CapEx is lumpy from quarter to quarter, depending on where we are able to make these investments.  Free cash flow finished the quarter with a strong $2.3 billion.
 So, in summary, we are very pleased with the performance in Q1 across revenue, margins and cash flow.  As a result, we are very optimistic and, therefore, pushing ahead with significant investments as I outlined to you a few moments ago.
 Finally, let me remind you, as I do every year at this time, that our revenue typically exhibits some seasonality between Q1, Q2 and Q3 because of the coming summer months.
 With that and before we open it up to questions, we will have Susan and Jeff cover their comments, and then we will come back to Q&A.  Thank you and I will turn it to Susan.

Susan Wojcicki,  Google - VP, Product Management    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

           Thanks, Patrick.  I would like to take this opportunity today to talk about some of the big areas of investment in our advertising business -- search, display and mobile -- and how they are going so far.  We see a lot of opportunity to innovate in these categories and to make the ads better and more useful.  As we expand to new kinds of inventory beyond search, our goal is to enable high performance across media campaigns from within AdWords.
 Let me start with search.  Starting about a year ago, we asked ourselves why do search ads just have to be text links.  In organic search the right result might be a video, a book, or an update from a social network.  We call this universal search.  But ads are also information.  They are commercial information, and in many cases it may be more useful to the user and the advertiser if we show a video or a picture or a product in the ad.
 For example, if you search on the query HP all-in-one printer, some of the ads now include pictures of HP printers, prices and where you can buy them.  Or if you are looking for a movie and you search on The Losers, the ad may give you the option to watch the movie trailer right within the ad.
 Other ads, which we call Sitelinks, enable advertisers to drive traffic to specific parts of their site.  The query Toys "R" Us is a good example of this with links to products the retailer is promoting such as Nerf toy specials or pre-ordering Barbies.  The idea is to make the ads more useful and therefore higher performing, and so far they are doing very well.  Click-through rates on Sitelinks, for example, are up as much as 30% to 40%.
 We also want to give advertisers more data and insight into their campaigns and customers.  Users usually go through a progression of searches and can interact with a number of ads before actually buying the product.
 For example, a user may search and click on ads first for a digital camera and then on Canon before actually clicking on an ad for the Powershot S90 and buying the camera.  To help use advertisers optimize for this behavior, we have launched a new reporting feature this quarter called the Search Funnel, which tells advertisers about those earlier searches and the ads the users interacted with earlier in the buying process.  By thinking about the right portfolio of key words, advertisers can maximize their conversion.
 Moving on to our display business, we have seen very strong momentum.  We are investing heavily in three different areas -- our platform, which includes the DoubleClick suite of products, our Ad Exchange, and our content network and YouTube.  We are bringing the performance, efficiency and measurability to the display world like we did with search, which we believe can overall grow the display market and benefit everyone.
 On the platform side this quarter, we have launched the largest Google and DoubleClick integration to date, a new version of DoubleClick for publishers which has been rewritten on Google technologies.  The new version gives publishers more data and better tools to manage and maximize their return directly and indirectly sold ad space.
 We are also doubling down on our new Ad Exchange, the second pillar in our display strategy.  It is ramping nicely, and publishers and advertisers are getting great results.  Some publishers are increasing their yields by as much as 130% when compared to ads sold directly to ad networks.
 One of the key features that we are very excited about on the new exchange is real-time bidding, which enables advertisers to bid on an impression by impression basis using their own data.  By bringing this level of efficiency to display advertising buying, everyone wins.
 And third on the content network, we have introduced a number of new features in the past year.  It is a long list -- interspace advertising, frequency capping, above the fold targeting, new measurement tools, and many new formats among other features.  Combined they create a compelling platform for display advertisers to reach users globally.  This quarter we added a new feature that I would like to talk about called re-marketing.  Re-marketing enables advertisers to show ads to users who have visited their website or their YouTube channel.
 So if you're shopping around for a vacation destination or go to one resort site and then leave, when you visit another site in our network, that resort could show you an ad with a discount coupon.  As a user, this means I can get a much more compelling ad.  As an advertiser, it is an opportunity to connect with interested users.
 Mobile is also doing very well.  This will be an increasingly important form of advertising as users transition to smartphones with full browsers.  We want to make it easier for advertisers to extend their existing campaigns to mobile rather than having to start from scratch.  When advertisers run on desktop and mobile, we enable them to separate their campaign stats by desktop or mobile to understand their mobile performance.  Many of them are surprised by how much mobile activity they have received.  Based on this information, they can decide how to customize their mobile campaigns going forward.
 We also rolled out new formats and targeting options specific for mobile.  This quarter we launched a click-to-call feature that automatically puts a phone number in the ad that is running on a smartphone.  So if you're looking for auto insurance and do that query from your Android or iPhone, the ads will include a call, a number to call.  Not surprisingly, this has increased click-through or should I say call-through.  I'm just scratching the surface of all the innovations our ad team is working on, but I have to hand it over to Jeff now.
 Thank you.

Jeff Huber,  Google - SVP, Engineering    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

           Thanks, Susan.  Across all our products, we push ourselves to continually innovate.  We believe in open platforms that encourage everyone else to push innovation, too.  Our efforts in mobile are a great example of this at work.
 Eric Schmidt mentioned in a speech at the Mobile World Conference in Barcelona in February that we are taking a mobile first approach to most everything we do.  That means doing things that take advantage of the unique characteristics of mobile smartphones.
 One of those is that your smartphone knows where you are, your location.  So this quarter we launched a feature called Near Me Now that essentially turns your location into the search query.  If you go to Google.com from a smartphone, you will see the Near Me Now link right under the search box.  Click on it to see restaurants, cafes, shops, gas stations, ATMs and other things of interest that are closest to you.
 Another common use case is where you are searching for something at home and then want to find it again when you're out and about.  Our new stars in search feature helps out there.  You do a search, say, for a chili recipe, and when you find a great result, you click on the star next to it.  Later when you are at the grocery store to pick up the ingredients, you just repeat the search with your smartphone, which is easy to do with the Suggest feature.  Just type the first character or two, the query will pop up, or with voice search, which is increasingly ubiquitous across the platforms, and that starred result shows right up at the top.
 The same starred results now work on maps, too.  Do a search at home or work like on an ad res or for a restaurant, click a star next to the right result and that star shows up in your map on the smartphone, making it easy to get directions or get more information about it.  These are small features in some ways, but a big innovation in how smartphones can integrate into your everyday life.
 Our open platforms, Android and Chrome, are gaining a lot of momentum.  Android is now powering 34 devices, which is up 70% quarter over quarter, from 12 different OEMs.  And over 60,000 Android devices are sold and activated every day.
 Our whole mantra with Android is open.  First, the Android OS itself is open for partners to modify and extend on their own.  Then the Android market for apps is open for all developers, which is driving a lot of growth and great apps.  We are now at over 38,000 apps, up 70% quarter over quarter.  The net effect is to make Web-ready smartphones more widely available.  It is helping drive a lot of mobile search and apps usage.
 Chrome is also growing really well, mostly driven by its technical innovations and performance and its security relative to other browsers.  A new Chrome feature we launched just a couple of weeks ago helps address language as a barrier to Web use around the world.  Chrome can now automatically translate any page you are viewing into any one of 52 different languages.  So if you're an English speaker and want to read the local news in Paris, you can go to LeMonde.fr, and Chrome will offer to translate the page for you.
 Uptake has been great.  We are already translating over 60 million pages per day.  If we can help knock down the language barrier through innovative features like this, the Web becomes a lot more accessible and useful for everyone around the world.
 Our latest open ecosystem effort is the apps marketplace for Google apps.  Many of our enterprise customers want to move more of their operations to the cloud, including applications that Google does not offer like CRM, accounting, project management, workflow automation, HR, the list goes on.  The apps marketplace has had thousands of enterprise apps purchased and installs ready, all integrated with the Google Apps experience.
 Finally, we are looking forward to our new Google I/O Developer Conference coming up in May.  I/O sold out in just a few days as developers know that in the event's short history we have used it to announce some pretty amazing things in addition to covering a huge amount of content on how they can innovate with and leverage Google's open platforms.  When you open up the Web and unleash the passion and innovation of thousands and thousands of developers, great things happen.
 Thanks for your time.  Back to Patrick.

Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP & CFO    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

           Thank you, Jeff, and thank you, Susan.  So what we will do now is I will invite Nikesh also to join us and ask Maria to open up the call for questions, and then Maria will direct the questions for us. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maria Shim,  Google - IR    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

           Operator, can we start taking questions, please?



================================================================================
Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     (Operator Instructions).  James Mitchell, Goldman Sachs. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
James Mitchell,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Two questions and I apologize because one of them is really nitpicky.  But in your cash flow statement, you have got a repurchase of stock minus $97 million.  And I thought that Google would not buy back stock until the AdMob acquisition was complete.
 And then second question is, with regard to domestic and international revenue, it is great that your domestic revenue is growing almost as fast now as your international revenue.  But it's also a little bit surprising to me.  Is that primarily because you have got more new activities like Nexus One contributing domestically than internationally, or does that reflect a more V-shaped recovery domestically than internationally? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP & CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     So I will take the first question, and then I will let Nikesh answer the second one.  On the first one it is because when we bought On2, what we wanted to do is -- it was a shared transaction you will remember.  And because it was a shared transaction, we decided to actually re-buy back the shares thereafter to make it a cash transaction.  So it is that simple for that transaction.
 For the international, Nikesh? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nikesh Arora,  Google - President, Global Sales Operations and Business Development    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Yes, thanks for your question.  I think it is a combination of the things you suggest and a bit more.  We are seeing a better recovery in the domestic market definitely if you look at the comps from last year.  Clearly the numbers look much better.  We are seeing tremendous activity from our large advertisers who are coming back in droves and actually reconfirming their faith in search advertising.  So that is all working.
 Plus, many of our product innovations start in the US, which allows us to drive those revenues faster in the US.
 Having said that, internationally our revenues did not take as material a dip as relative to the US.  So clearly the comps are much stronger on the international side.  And it is a basket of many, many, many countries.  So we are seeing recovery in some of the major markets.  Some of the markets are still not on that curve of recovery as we are seeing in some of the more mature, larger markets in Europe. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP & CFO    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     But we are very happy with both trajectories.  Thanks for your question.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Mahaney,  Citi - Analyst    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     What percentage of your revenue now would come from mobile display and enterprise gross basis?  Secondly, is Nexus One as a group profitable?  And third, could you give us a little color on the CPC rates?  Given the dramatic falloff in conversion rates due to the economy in the fourth quarter of '08, first quarter of '09, it's reasonable to expect that perhaps CPCs would have risen more.  Is there something else we should think about as kind of tempering the growth in CPCs now? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP & CFO    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Great.  Remind me of your first question? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Mahaney,  Citi - Analyst    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     What percentage of your revenue comes from mobile display and enterprise combined? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP & CFO    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Okay.  So that one unfortunately we cannot give you.  We do not divulge that kind of information.  On the Nexus and then Susan can give you the answer on CPC.  On the Nexus One, it is a profitable business for us.  We don't give more details on the economics, but we are driving the business to be a profitable business from the get-go.
 So on CPC maybe Susan can give us more comments as to what is going on. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Susan Wojcicki,  Google - VP, Product Management    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Sure.  I will give a couple of comments about the CPCs.  So I think there are a number of trends that we see.  I think it is important to remember, first of all, that the CPC and the numbers that we release are an aggregate number.  And so there are a couple of things happening.
 One of them has to do with the growth rates of the different regions and CPCs being different in the different regions.  The second thing, which I believe is a long-term positive for Google but may be reflected in the CPC number here, is that we are releasing a lot of tools to enable advertisers to try to find more, what I will call, long tail keywords.  So keywords that they might not have been bidding on beforehand and that they might not be the more competitive ones, and so, as a result, the CPCs may vary.  And we believe long-term that is good because we're actually selling more keywords, and the auctions are becoming more competitive but it may change the mix.

     A few questions.  One, do you expect to continue to be the default search provider on Apple products going forward?  And then if I look at the quarter correctly, it looks like you hired about 800 people.  Is there anything unique about that number?  Is that roughly the right number you think you're going to be hiring on a go forward basis?
 And then finally, if there is any other particular comments you could make around Eric not being on the call, anything else we should read into that.  Thanks. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP & CFO    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Why don't we take them in reverse order.  Eric is everywhere.  Eric is in every public -- I mean I have seen him in Abu Dhabi and then fly across to DC the next day.  He is everywhere.
 So the fact that we just decided to streamline our process just for earnings does not mean that Eric is not available, and he is clearly leading as spokesperson for the strategy of the Company.  So he's very transparent and everywhere.
 So on that point it was just simply an issue of kind of streamlining and making more focus on financial results for this call.  You should not read any more or less than that in this decision.
 On the 800 people, look, we have talked about ever since last summer that we are trying to ramp up our machine to hire back specifically in engineering, specifically in the support of sales where we see great opportunities.  And it takes a couple of quarters to ramp up the machine so that we get the levels that we want.  So we are very pleased with the hires we have done.
 The bar at Google, let me re-emphasize that, has not changed.  It is incredibly high.  But we're very pleased of the on-boarding that we have seen this quarter, and now that this infrastructure is in place, you can expect us to continue to invest heavily in this form.  And we have so many projects that we would love to have more engineers right now that we would like to fuel our growth.  But it is really paramount to us to continue to focus on it.
 On the Apple, maybe Jeff can comment.  Mute? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jeff Huber,  Google - SVP, Engineering    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Yes, we cannot speculate on the specific relationship around search.  We have historically had a strong relationship with Apple across a number of different areas, and we hope to and look forward to continuing that in the future.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Imran Khan,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     I have two questions.  One question is about paid clicks growth rate.  So considering that mobile is growing significantly faster and some of the international countries growing significantly faster, paid clicks growth rate is 15%.  Is it fair to assume that the domestic paid clicks growth rate has decelerated significantly?  And can you give us some color how should we think about the domestic paid clicks growth rate?
 And second question is more of a long-term threat to Google.  If we look at third-party data, it seems like Facebook and other social networking sites while still very low are becoming a bigger part.  They are growing significantly faster as a traffic source to a lot of your big customers like eBay.  How do you think Facebook or other social networking sites is a big long-term threat to Google's business model?

Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP & CFO    [18]

     So why don't I let Jeff talk about the issue of Facebook, and then Susan can cover the CPC growth rate.  Susan, do you want to start?  Or Jeff?  Okay, Jeff, start. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jeff Huber,  Google - SVP, Engineering    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     With regards to other folks out there, I guess our net view is that we don't see things as a zero sum game whatsoever.  Looking at the Internet and the vibrancy and rate of growth across the Internet, other people are growing.  We are very happy with our growth.  So we don't see that as a significant issue. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP & CFO    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Susan? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Susan Wojcicki,  Google - VP, Product Management    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Yes, I will comment on the paid click growth.  Overall I think we have been very happy with the number and the growth that we have seen.  And it is a result of a number of things.  Certainly the advertisers coming back, some of the largest advertisers spending more money on Google, as well as the growth across the board in all regions.  But with also some of the new ad formats that I spoke about have brought more clicks to advertisers because they are coming up with formats that are more compelling for users and offering information that is very useful for the users onboard, and that is causing a lot of growth in paid clicks. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP & CFO    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     In closing on that one, the bottom line is we see it everywhere.  It is not one versus another, and that is true for both of the questions that you have asked.

Justin Post,  Bank of America - Analyst    [24]

     Two things.  Last year you were able to give us some intra-quarter guidance about how a quarter started and ended.  Do you feel better about a trajectory of year-over-year growth exiting the quarter than you did entering the quarter?
 And then secondly, on marketing spend I think it is up 48% year-over-year, excluding stock-based comp.  I always thought of you as more of a technology-driven company.  Why so much marketing spend, and can you talk about maybe your ROI thinking about it, or what is it really going to get for Google? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP & CFO    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Yes, so on the latter one, on the marketing spend, look, it is clear that we have opportunities, and I will give you a couple of examples.  One is there is a ballot in Europe right now for Chrome, or there are markets in which there's a lot of appetite for on-boarding customers, and so we get great ROIs.  And, Nikesh, maybe you have additional comments. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nikesh Arora,  Google - President, Global Sales Operations and Business Development    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     I think it is important to understand, our marketing spend for the most part is ROI-based.  If you look at -- we spend marketing dollars to go and acquire advertisers on our B2B side.  We spend marketing dollars to promote various products.  So it's very clear for us to understand for each dollar we spend what return we get in terms of long-term value from each customer that is acquired for (inaudible) products which create additional monetization across our properties.  So you can expect us to spend marketing dollars as and when we see it is relevant for our long-term strategy to have lots more users for our products and lots more advertisers. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP & CFO    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     In closing on that one, if you think of G&A in general at, Google you'll find that our G&A is actually at 20 some percent of revenue.  I mean it is not moving that much.  And what you see is a shift between regular G&A is actually going down, which is the good news.  And you are seeing, if we have an incremental dollar in the great -- as Nikesh said, good ROI base, I mean we should take the opportunity on that.
 As it relates to your first question on -- we don't give comments.  We had such a crisis in the last 18 months that back then it may have made sense to give some color about quarters.  But clearly Q4 to Q1 we just look at the level of economic activity, and it is continuing to pick up, which is a great benefit to Google.

     The first question is on the Nexus One, and in particular can you comment on how many phones you sold during the quarter and if possible you could change the distribution plan going forward so that they actually are in stores rather than just online?
 And then secondly, can you comment on China as well and perhaps give us an update there in terms of what you are seeing and any thoughts you might have on what percentage of the business or percentage of the revenue you might be able to hold onto in that market going forward? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP & CFO    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     So I will let Jeff answer the Nexus and then I will cover China. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jeff Huber,  Google - SVP, Engineering    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     We are not disclosing the specific number of Nexus One devices sold.  We are very happy with the device uptake and the kind of impact that has had across the industry of raising the bar and people's expectations of what a great smartphone can do.  I did earlier mention that across the Android landscape that we are seeing more than 60,000 devices sold in activations daily.  On stores, sorry, we cannot comment anything about that right now. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP & CFO    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Let me comment on China.  Look, we have made -- we have explained to people that the revenue numbers for China were kind of immaterial to the financial performance of the Company in the previous blogs and communications.  The bottom line, though, on China is this was a tough situation where we really believe we have made the right decision.
 Google stands for really important values like openness, user choice, protection of privacy, and these are -- in a Company that remains true to its values, that is what you do.  You make a decision that is driven by those values.
 Having said that, what we have announced a few weeks ago, right, or a few days ago clearly has us staying in China.  I mean we have just changed our strategy and adapted our strategy, but our engineering force remains in China and will continue to develop great products.  We continue to keep our sales force in place because there is still an export market and then a lot of opportunity in China for sales.  And what we have done is move back to Hong Kong for search where we can offer it uncensored.  So from that perspective, you should see a lot of positive moves on the base of Google but made the right call.

Brian Pitz,  UBS - Analyst    [34]

     Can you give us an update on where you are in terms of renewing your distribution deal with News Corp.?  And then a quick question on mobile.  Is there a Plan B if AdMob does not go through, and also can you comment on whether you see mobile services eventually being delivered essentially through the browser much like the PC rather than individual application downloads? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP & CFO    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Let me just comment on AdMob, and then Susan will probably give more commentary on the monetization.  But the case for AdMob is there is overwhelming evidence that the mobile advertising industry both in terms of platforms and providers, it is nascent.  It is incredibly competitive.  It did not exist 24 months ago.  There's dozens of ad networks out there.  And even last week you may have heard that there was an announcement from Apple that they were starting their own.  I mean it is incredibly competitive, and that is why we believe that actually we are very positive about making this transaction happen.  The case is on our side.
 Now on the specifics of monetization, maybe Susan can give a bit more color commentary. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Susan Wojcicki,  Google - VP, Product Management    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Well, I was just going to comment since you asked about Plan B.  I will say that Google does have a monetization product for monetizing mobile applications, AdSense for mobile applications, and that is a product that we are investing in and we have seen good growth with that one.  But I just want to reiterate the point that Patrick said, which is that we see it as a very new and nascent market.  It is less than two-years-old, and there is a lot of competition in this market.  So we are continuing to work with the FTC on AdMob.
 Your other comment was about ad applications versus Web, and Google is investing and believes that HTML 5 has the opportunity to enable a lot richer applications on the Web.  And that is something that we are investing in, and we will see over time how applications and HTML 5 both developed. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nikesh Arora,  Google - President, Global Sales Operations and Business Development    [37]

     And let me go back to the very first question you asked, I think the News Corp.  question was around (multiple speakers) the MySpace deal.  Look, we are working -- Google wants every partner in the sense that it is good for the ecosystem.  It is good for our partners.  It gives them opportunities for monetization.  We are in negotiations right now of a deal that is going to be renewed.  And these deals were, like in the case of that specific one, was done a number of years ago with completely different industry dynamics.  So we're working with them to find a real win-win, and you just stay tuned for when we have an announcement.

Spencer Wang,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Just two quick questions.  First, on the paid click growth, which is up 15% year over year, that actually re-accelerated for the first time in a couple of years.  So I was wondering, Susan, if you could just give us a sense of what is driving that?  Is it a combination of Sitelinks?  How much of it is mobile, etc.?
 And then secondly, just for Patrick, G&A looks like ex-stock comp was actually down year over year.  Is that the rough right absolute level we should be thinking about for the rest of the year? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP & CFO    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Do you want to comment first, Susan? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Susan Wojcicki,  Google - VP, Product Management    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Yes, on paid click.  I think it is a combination of a lot of different factors, and it is really important to remember that this is also an aggregate number across all of our businesses.  So, as we saw advertisers come back and start spending again, driven by a lot of our largest advertisers really increasing their spend, as well as Google and the ads team bringing a lot of new types of products to market in terms of the Sitelinks product, which had not just one place to click but multiple places to click, we started seeing advertisers have higher click-throughs.  And so all of those higher click-throughs that I talked about do manifest themselves in terms of the aggregate paid click number.  Mobile is a component of many different types of inventory that Google is expanding to to increase the overall paid click number. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP & CFO    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     On the G&A, Spencer, the short answer is, we are going to continue to be disciplined just like you see in the ramp -- the run rate and the ramp-ups that you see.  So we are very disciplined.  This place continues to be frugal in many ways.
 On the other side, right, we are hiring.  We are hiring, and it is obviously lumpy.  So the point is we are every time I can find another great engineer to add to the Chrome OS platform, I'm going to hire him.  We are going to hire them.  Google needs them.  On the flip side, there is a lot of discipline around.  It's not like you do whatever you want around here.  There is discipline.

Ross Sandler,  RBC - Analyst    [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Two quick questions for the cash.  If you look at year-over-year growth in the UK versus ROW on an organic basis, they were about the same.  Can you talk about what areas in ROW are outperforming and which ones are underperforming?
 And you had mentioned a couple -- a month or two ago that there was some paid click cleanup in the fourth quarter.  Was there any of that in 1Q, and can you talk about the growth rate of O&O clicks versus -- or Google website clicks versus partner site clicks? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nikesh Arora,  Google - President, Global Sales Operations and Business Development    [45]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     In terms of UK versus rest of the world, I think rest of the world for us performs even better than the UK did in the last quarter.
 Having said that, as I mentioned, there are parts to the rest of the world which are continuing to perform really well for us.  Places like Brazil, which we talked about last quarter.  Places like Russia, etc.  continue to perform well.  There are some parts of the European economy, as you are aware, which are still undergoing some correction like Greece, where clearly you cannot expect us to be performing so well.
 So there are pockets of strong performance in the rest of the world.  They are pretty much in line with our expectations in terms of trends we are seeing, which are dependent on broadband penetration, dependent on the e-commerce activity, dependent on the small business' adoption to the Internet.  And as that -- as those curves continue to go up, we continue to see corresponding (inaudible) performance of those markets, and we are planning our growth strategy in those markets along those lines. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP & CFO    [46]

     I think the keyword refinancing for Greece should be a pretty popular one.

     Yes, cleanup of the paid click -- 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nikesh Arora,  Google - President, Global Sales Operations and Business Development    [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Yes, we did do a slightly outside of normal cleanup in the last quarter.  But I think our activity -- we are constantly making sure that we are taking care of spam and we are taking care of advertising situations where we don't believe that's appropriate business.  We do that on a regular basis.  We have done nothing extraordinary in this quarter.  Last quarter we did look at our policies in certain areas and clean it up, which is why we mentioned it in the last call.

Mary Meeker,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [51]

     So just one clarification and then a question.  So on the cost per click decline, 4% sequentially, by our math, if you exclude Forex, the decline was probably closer to 2.5%.  And just we want to try to rank order the drivers of the sequential decline.  And our thinking is that Forex was the number one driver of the decline.  The second was the geographic mix, which is an ongoing issue, was the second driver.  The third was related to the tools that Susan spoke about to find more long tail keywords, which over time should drive CPCs higher or certainly assist CPCs.  The fourth was the slower economic recovery in Europe versus the US and your comment about Greece related to that.  And the fifth was another Susan comment, the product innovations roll out in the US first, which over time if they roll out in the non-US markets should help CPCs outside the US.
 One you did not really mention was mobile, which is probably a factor as well.  Is that the right laundry list of drivers of a sequential CPC decline and the right list in the right order in your view, Patrick? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP & CFO    [52]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Mary, I think that you have in essence the right laundry list.  And I can tell you that the FX anybody because that's public information on FX.  You can -- it is a big contributor to that 4%.
 For the other last element of the equation is always the mix between Google properties versus the partner properties, which also has and especially in the case of international, the UK.  So you have all the elements of what you talked about.  Plus, you have to look at your mix between the dot-com properties versus the partner properties.
 Now we don't give you the breakdown of all the elements as you know.  But you have the right basket if you include the last one I just gave you. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mary Meeker,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [53]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Okay.  And then the question and I'm going to give you a fun name is you have been telling us about lumpiness in CapEx for a really long time.  CapEx has been actually very constrained, and the phrase is going to be lumpy but disciplined.  You have been talking about investments in people for the last couple of quarters.  You increased your headcount about 4% sequentially, but your operating spending per employee was flat sequentially.  And the question we have is, as you grow as you should, do you think you can continue to keep OpEx per employee flat sequentially?  So we will call it lumpy but disciplined. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP & CFO    [54]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     I mean that is the intent.  The intent is you on-board Googlers, right, they take real estate, they take computers, they take computing power.  But it's not -- I mean, for the models that we have right now in the spaces where we are, I mean, it is really about software development and sales.  So that is the intent absolutely.
 And then on the CapEx side, I could argue it could grow 8% quarter over quarter right.  But you are absolutely right.  We are very disciplined about it, and we're very proud of, in fact, getting so much yield out of our infrastructure.  But there's always -- remember, I tell this because, when it will happen, just like we had talked about a few quarters ago that we are ramping up on hiring, in the same way when there is a great opportunistic purchase on assets, we will be there.

Jeetil Patel,  Deutsche - Analyst    [56]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     A couple of questions.  I guess coming off the bottom obviously from an ad market standpoint, can you, I guess, talk about are you seeing from your marketers, at least in the US and customers, a different allocation of ad dollars between search and display ads and other initiatives such as product listings and the like as you come up from Q4 to Q1 and beyond?
 The second question is, I guess we continue to believe in you guys investing in the business.  I'm just curious with the incremental 800 adds, I guess is there one or two sets of projects that you are allocating incremental investment against whether it be mobile or YouTube or what have you, just to give us a flavor of where you're headed from a product innovation and traffic growth standpoint?  And then I have a quick follow-up. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP & CFO    [57]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Jeff can talk about where all the areas where we are deploying the engineering, and then obviously Nikesh will answer the first question.  So, Jeff, do you want to give a sense of where we are plowing resources? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jeff Huber,  Google - SVP, Engineering    [58]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Sure.  The combination of the core businesses is strong and growing.  So we are continuing to invest in that.  Susan went through in her section a lot of the innovations and new products that we have introduced in the core search and display ads business.  Some of the other major areas of engineering investment are some of the things that I cited.  The open platforms, Android and Chrome, are growing very quickly and having a big impact.  We are also investing incrementally in the Apps and Enterprise business where we are seeing very strong growth and a lot of customer uptake there. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nikesh Arora,  Google - President, Global Sales Operations and Business Development    [59]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Let me answer the headcount question first then I can go back and talk about the marketeers and the advertisers.
 As Jeff mentioned, on the business side, we are continuing to add resources selectively in search as we see the market continuing to grow, as well as deploying it in markets where we see higher growth as I mentioned earlier.
 In addition to that, we are putting a significant amount of resources in our display space as the product team continues to enhance our display offering and give us more features.  That will continue to be a focus for us throughout the year going forward.
 In terms of what we are seeing from marketeers, I think the pullback we had seen about six to nine months ago is all gone.  What has also happened in (inaudible) is I continue to see tremendous amounts of capability building on the advertiser side.
 One of the challenges we always have, you can go to an advertiser, pitch them on a tremendous search campaign.  However, they feel like we can lead the horse to the water, but they still have trouble making him drink because their websites are not fully capable of conducting the e-commerce transactions to the level they would like.
 Having said that, I have seen tremendous amounts of capability improvement in the last six to nine months across a majority of our mature markets, both the US, UK, Germany, France, etc., which allows us to go ahead with bigger, more larger campaigns for these guys, and they are beginning to understand that search is diminishing inventory.  If you don't buy today, it is not going to be there tomorrow.  So they have to be more willing to be flexible with their budgets and be open depending on what is going on.
 And they are very -- they are getting more and more averse to the ways of search.  So clearly we are seeing them get more flexible with their dollars in the search side.  They are beginning to understand the value of products like Susan mentioned like re-marketing and how to use the display networks effectively in sort of a CPC model and a CPM model depending on which one they choose.  So clearly, in the more mature markets, we are seeing awareness of the digital market space.  We are seeing them keep the search budgets open, and we are seeing tremendous amounts of engagement from their side. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP & CFO    [60]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Just in closing on that point, I think that the display market is seeing such an evolution because of simplicity of the tools that did not exist a year ago are now here, and people now have the choice of participating and participating actively, and in these campaigns now love to have the flexibility to move from one to another to find the right audience.  So a tremendous progress we have seen in display, and we are very encouraged by what we see. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jeetil Patel,  Deutsche - Analyst    [61]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     I guess a question to Nikesh's commentary, I guess if companies are having a hard time getting the transaction in the door once they get the traffic and small business has that same issue, would you ever look at a model such as a percentage of sale model to go to eliminate that issue and have the transaction occur on site? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nikesh Arora,  Google - President, Global Sales Operations and Business Development    [62]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Well, I think I don't actually interpret what I said carefully.  To be fair, most of the small businesses are very, very good with allocation.  As you have seen us a few quarters ago, we've seen a dip in large advertisers and not in small advertisers because they have always been ROI-driven.  They totally understand how to bring in a search lead and how to convert that search lead into dollars.
 I think the challenge of the large advertiser has been that as a proportion of their total advertising revenue they have not been able to allocate a lot of dollars to research.  Hence, now as they have built up their capability, they are able to do that more effectively. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Susan Wojcicki,  Google - VP, Product Management    [63]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     This is Susan.  One additional thing I would like to add is we definitely see an opportunity to move to taking a percentage of the conversion.  In fact, we call this CPA, cost per acquisition.  And one of the products that was developed in this area that we are optimistic about is the product ad product.  And the way that works is the retailer just gives us all of the information about their products, the price, the listing, description, etc., and then Google actually does the targeting to decide where to show those ads.  And then we take a percentage when the product is actually purchased, when the user actually converts.  And we do see that as an opportunity to really simplify the process for advertisers over time, and it is something we are investing in.

     Let me ask just a bit about expenses.  So did Nexus One have a material impact on sales and marketing expenses in the quarter?
 And then number two, when we look at seasonal patterns of expenses last year, they increased as a percent of revenue in the second quarter.  Should we expect a similar pattern this year, or is each year different based on your initiatives? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP & CFO    [66]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Just to make it simple, on the Nexus One, we did not have a material advertising for it.  And then on the second one, I would not provide any guidance for the coming quarters.  So I would leave it at that.

     Two quick ones, one for Patrick, one for Susan, starting with you Patrick.  I just want to go back to the China issue and understand a little bit better what you said.  So is serving China from Hong Kong a sustainable strategy for you guys?  Doesn't that put you at a strong disadvantage versus a native player over time?
 And then to Susan, among the many products that you cited, product search, Sitelinks, image ads, etc., help us understand which one or which one or two are having the most impacts on conversion rates and CPCs? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP & CFO    [69]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     So on the case of China, obviously we still have sales in China.  And the fact that we serve them in Hong Kong and from Hong Kong does not stop us from having all the opportunities that we want from the Chinese markets.  And remember that there is a huge industrial infrastructure all around Hong Kong and south of China.  So it is really addressing a market from a different perspective, and our sales force is ready to serve them from there. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Youssef Squali,  Jefferies - Analyst    [70]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Mostly for exporters? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP & CFO    [71]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     It is both actually because we really have both opportunities.  What we have really done, if you think about it, is we've stopped censoring.  But the access to Google is still available for all Chinese people through (inaudible).  I will leave it to Susan to answer the second question. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Susan Wojcicki,  Google - VP, Product Management    [72]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     So from an impact standpoint, some of the biggest changes that we make that impact the product and all the metrics, not just CPC but percentage of click growth, etc., a lot of them have to do with changes in ad quality that we make in the quarter.  And the reason is because if we can make a percentage increase off of that very large business, that can have a significant impact.  And so we had a, what we will say, a modest quarter from ad quality.  We had more than a dozen different launches that were significant across the board, and they certainly over time do play an important role in how they affect the metrics.
 The other thing I would like to point out that I think also is really an important thing to look at with our overall business is something we have introduced in AdWords called Opportunity Center.  An Opportunity Center is a way for advertisers to know this is how many more clicks I should be getting or could be getting.  And so what we want to do is we want to give a lot more guidance to advertisers in terms of here are more keywords.  They are very easy to add to your keyword list.  We just launched this quarter, for example, bid suggestions to give them an understanding of what are the trade-offs between volume and CPCs and where is the optimal place that they should be bidding as well as budget suggestions.  And because this is a -- because Opportunity Center is applied to the core business and to all of our advertisers, it can move the metrics over time in terms of getting more advertisers to buy keywords or increase their budgets or change their bids.

     I had two.  I wondered if you could give some color around the paid click and cost per click growth as it relates to O&O and the network?  Did paid clicks grow faster on the O&O network or on the AdSense network and the same for CPCs?
 And then the second question is, there are a lot of innovative companies in the display space.  Earlier you mentioned remarketing, but generally speaking, there are others out there doing remarketing.  So my question is, what are the top couple of things that Google is doing that is different in the area of display particularly from a targeting standpoint that is meaningfully differentiated? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP & CFO    [75]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Alright.  So, on the first one, I will punt because we do not divulge the split between O&O and other properties.  But I'm sure Susan will talk about the display innovations. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Susan Wojcicki,  Google - VP, Product Management    [76]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Sure.  So you brought up some questions about remarketing and what we are doing there that is unique.  Yes, we definitely agree with you that display is a really vibrant space, and there is a lot of innovation that is happening right now in the display market.  And I think ultimately that innovation will enable the market as a whole to grow.
 But one of the things that we have that is very unique from the remarketing perspective is users or advertisers can re-find users across the content network.  And the content network because we have so many publishers in our site and because we are a global network as well, it gives advertisers the opportunity to expand and find a lot more of those users across the network than they probably can with a lot of other options.
 The other thing that we're doing from a targeting perspective is we're trying to make it really easy for advertisers to work with existing interfaces.  So right now you can do remarketing within AdWords.  So if you are an AdWords advertiser, you can do the remarketing there.  If you are a DSA advertiser, then you can also do it from that perspective as well.
 The other thing that is important is from a -- because you also asked about different types of targeting.  We offer a number of different targetings that we think are unique.  And the one of them that we are best known for is the contextual targeting.  So the ability to actually figure out on a page what this page is about dynamically and then serve an ad that is matched to that one specifically.
 Then we also have placement targeting where we give advertisers the ability to choose where they want their ads to appear by actually selecting -- these are the sites, and this is where I want them to appear.  So the combination of all of these things together give advertisers a large number of options, and we're thinking about how these things actually work together.  So how do all of these different targeting mechanisms, how do you combine them in a way to provide the best options for the advertisers and users.

     And when you said content network, you do include YouTube in there?

     Yes, we do include it within there.

     Actually I have a drill down question on Sitelinks and image ads.  The question I have is, really, just how do I think about the pervasiveness of these new ad formats?  Over what percentage of queries or what percentage of advertisers do you think it is relevant?  It seems like it would be a relatively narrow set of very commercial queries for very response-driven advertisers.  How far penetrated are we, and how new is this? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Susan Wojcicki,  Google - VP, Product Management    [81]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     You are right that Sitelinks is new, and we are really just beginning to penetrate all the advertisers that I think would benefit from the Sitelinks feature.  We do see Sitelinks appearing mostly on navigational queries where the user is looking for the brand name or the product category.  But it is a very powerful tool, and we believe there's still a lot of advertisers that are not using it today that would benefit from it.
 The other thing I will say about Sitelinks is it is rolled out globally.  And so when you look at the combination of all the different companies and advertisers globally that could benefit from this, we are just getting started because we have just started rolling those out in Q4.

     Marianne Wolk, Susquehanna. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Wolk,  Susquehanna - Analyst    [83]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     I have two quick questions.  The first is, with regard to your mobile advertising, it sounds like it is an opt-out program now for most AdWords users.  Is that true and would you also include in-app ads as an opt-out global choice as well?
 And then also, is it fair to say, based on the comments you made about the content network, that the mix shifted from the content partners -- to the content partners from the search partners by several points this quarter?  And did the content network also grow much faster in the UK this period than in the US?  I know you rolled out video and display ads on the content network.  Can you talk about the uptake there and any positive impact that has had on pricing? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP & CFO    [84]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Sorry, the first one -- could you just repeat your questions, so we'll all just write them down. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Wolk,  Susquehanna - Analyst    [85]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Sure.  On the mobile advertising side, it sounds like you're saying it is an opt-out platform. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP & CFO    [86]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Yes, the opt-out issue.  The second one was about the UK versus other geographies for take-up rates for different formats? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Wolk,  Susquehanna - Analyst    [87]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     No, for the content network.  For the content network and whether you're getting any pricing benefit there from the introduction of display and video ads recently. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP & CFO    [88]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Okay.  Susan, do you want to take these? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Susan Wojcicki,  Google - VP, Product Management    [89]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Yes, I will take both of them.  So, on the mobile component, I will say that we do give advertisers the option to -- the default is for advertisers to be on search content and mobile.  And the reason we do that is because we want to make it as easy as possible for advertisers to get as much reach and reach as many potential users as possible, and we try to do the right thing for those advertisers.  So the default is for them to be opted into both.
 However, we do offer the ability for advertisers to run a mobile only campaign.  And under that mobile only campaign, we give them the option to target, for example, a specific mobile OS, and we give a lot of options within the mobile category.  But I would really think about that more for advertisers who have the capabilities and are advanced enough to know that this -- these are the capabilities that they want to do and customize their campaign in order to make it worthwhile for them.
 On the formats question, I will also say we definitely have been introducing new formats into the display network, and we have been really excited about that.  In fact, we have a product called Display Ad Builder, and Display Ad Builder is a way -- it is a template system that enables us to have lots of different ad formats and to add them very, very easily to our network.  And from an advertiser standpoint, they are very, very easy, too, to actually start and get running.  It is really just a click, click, click and your ad can be running.  Your display ad can be running.
 So because the content network and the way that we choose which ad is actually run is an auction, if display is winning, then it is winning because it is actually a higher CPM ad.  And so by bringing display ads to the mix with text, there is more competition and there is more variety.  So when it makes sense for a display ad to run, then it wins the auction, and then because it won the auction, then it is bidding more than the existing text ad.  And so over time that can bring positive competition to the auction.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aaron Kessler,  Kaufman Brothers - Analyst    [91]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Yes, a couple of questions.  First, can you give us a little more details on the travel and retail verticals?  I know you said all the verticals are strong.  Any more color there?  And then just updates on your hedging program would be helpful, just your thoughts going forward with the hedges? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP & CFO    [92]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Maybe I can start with the hedges and then turn it to Nikesh.  Look, our hedging program is really effective.  I just want to remind everybody for us it is an insurance policy.  It is an insurance policy for high volatility and specifically if the US dollar strengthens dramatically.
 And so if you look at where the euro was a year ago versus where it was 90 days ago versus where it is now, I mean -- and then you go back to last year as we discussed, we had booked at this time last year big hedging revenues.  It was mostly because we had such a massive appreciation of the US dollar.  So for us very effective in finding the right sweet spot to make sure that we have the right coverage.
 On what we are caught with is the accounting rules, which some quarters like last quarter, right, had very little FAS 133 ruling pushing through the P&L, and this quarter has a disproportionate amount.  They do not represent our regular cost of hedging.  So it creates a bit of a kind of a fluctuation for you to model, but in the end we are very happy with what we are getting out of it.
 In terms of the verticals I will turn it to Nikesh.

Nikesh Arora,  Google - President, Global Sales Operations and Business Development    [93]

     As you mentioned, travel and retail have been strong.  I also alluded to the capability building, which for e-commerce, which is primarily I was talking about the retail vertical where we are seeing good strength.
 Travel is growing strong and is steady.  Retail and travel end up being some of our larger verticals in the entire landscape.  Having said that, I'm seeing good strength as well from CPG and entertainment because that's where a lot of the display advertisers like to focus those verticals into those smaller numbers.  Those verticals are not traditionally strong search verticals, but they definitely play in the display space and a lot of the display efforts have been targeted in those verticals.

     Patrick, was there any tension between Sergey and Eric over China, and could that be tied at all to why Eric is not on the call today? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP & CFO    [96]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     No.  I am sorry.  I should not -- (multiple speakers) thank you for the question.  I have a feeling that I have heard rumors -- I have heard every rumor.  So thank you for asking the question so candidly.  The answer is no.  There is nothing going on at all.  I mean it was really -- as we were doing the planning at the end of last year, through all the questions, every -- if you doubt that we actually scrub every department at Google, I will scrub two.  And the question that was asked is, what can you do differently to be better next year?  And one of the things on the list that we brought up in finance is, hey, maybe we should look at the quarterly call and the whole process and the webcast that we launched, and one of them was, hey, you know, we thought of this as an innovation.  It has nothing to do with anything.  (multiple speakers) 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colin Gillis,  BGC - Analyst    [97]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     I have got a quick follow-up.  The newer ad format, does that provide any lift at all to the CPCs? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP & CFO    [98]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The newer ad format? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The click to play video and things along those lines.

Nikesh Arora,  Google - President, Global Sales Operations and Business Development    [100]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     You know, I think it is important to understand some of the newer ad formats they're all mostly sold on a CPC basis and our newer ad formats are sold like traditionally in the display space.  We sell them as launch pages or homepages, so they are not paid on a click by click basis.

Scott Devitt,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [102]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Two questions, please.  The first one just a follow-up on Mary's laundry list question.  The comment about site revenue and network revenue mix, the site revenue and network revenue were both flat sequentially.  So I was wondering if you were suggesting that CPCs in the network are actually declining, if that was a contributor to the sequential decline in CPC?
 And then secondly, you recently indicated 50 million Chrome users, and I think Android smartphone shipments have been roughly 6 million per quarter run rates.  So your thoughts on shipping a tablet to take advantage of this momentum, thanks. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP & CFO    [103]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Let me answer in two ways.  We are really delighted by the Chrome take-up rate.  I mean it is a fast browser.  It is a secure browser.  It has all the elements that we have told about it.  So this is a terrific opportunity.
 In terms of tablets, the one announcement that we made last year you will remember with the launch of Chrome OS is we are working with manufacturers to have a netbook out sometime in the fall, and we are continuing to work diligently on this.  We are very excited about it, and we think that there's going to be a ton of innovation coming out of that.  So there is no doubt that we are pushing for it for all the reasons that you are mentioning.
 Can you remind me of your first question? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scott Devitt,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [104]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Sure.  The addition to the list earlier in terms of drivers of changes in CPC was the mix shift between site and network.  And, as we go back and look at the sequential growth rate of Google site revenue and Google network revenue, they are both basically flat.  So I was wondering if there was any implication from that CPC and one of those two actually changed more than the other? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google - SVP & CFO    [105]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     You know what?  I don't have the answer to that.  But what I will do is just we will follow up with you.  Maria?
