Presentation
Operator    [1]

          Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Google Inc. first-quarter 2015 earnings conference call.
(Operator Instructions)
As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ellen West, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, please go ahead.

Ellen West,  Google Inc. - VP of IR    [2]

          Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Google's first-quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With us today are Patrick Pichette and Omid Kordestani.
As you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at Investor.Google.com. So, please refer to our IR website for our earnings releases as well as the supplementary slides that accompany the call. This call is also being webcast from investor.Google.com. A replay of the calm will be available on our website later today.
Now let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding Google's future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses, and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.
For more information please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K for 2014 filed with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.
During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. The press release and an accompanying investor presentation are available on our website at Investor.Google.com. With that, I will now turn the call over to Patrick.

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc. - CFO    [3]

          Thank you, Ellen. Hello, everyone. I want to say at the outset that this quarter, Google turned in a strong performance, and this despite substantial currency headwinds. As we've all seen, the US dollar has continued to strengthen, which resulted in a gross negative currency impact on our revenues of $1.1 billion for the quarter.
Even after the significant benefits of our hedging program, the net impact to our gross revenue was still $795 million. If these currency trends persist, FX headwinds would obviously continue to impact our results in 2015.
For our results now, our gross total consolidated revenue was $17.3 billion, growing 12% year over year and declining 5% quarter over quarter. Without currency fluctuations, our gross total consolidated revenue growth is, in fact, a healthy 17% year over year. Despite significant FX pressure, Google Sitesrevenue was up a healthy 14% year over year, to $11.9 billion, and was down 4% quarter over quarter. Once again, strength in mobile search was the key driver of growth here.
Network revenue was up 1% year over year at $3.6 billion and down 8% quarter over quarter. As I mentioned last quarter, our network business includes two businesses with different growth profiles. Our legacy AdSense business, and our newer display and programmatic business where the latter continues to perform quite well.
This quarter, we reclassified some revenues primarily related to DoubleCick ad serving software from the other revenue to network revenue line. This reclassification increased network revenue by approximately $130 million in Q1, and decreased other revenue by the same amount. The display and programmatic business I mentioned early continued, as always, to be reflected in the network line. To see the impact of this reclass on historical periods please see the earnings slides on our IR website.
Finally, Google's other revenue grew 23% year over year to $1.8 billion, and was down 2% quarter over quarter. This is driven really by year-over-year growth from the Play Store, offset by a decline in Nexus and what I've mentioned the FX impact.
Our global aggregate paid clicks were up 13% year over year, down 1% quarter over quarter. Our aggregate CPCs were down 7% year over year and down 5% quarter over quarter. And on our monetization by property, Google sites paid clicks were up 25% year over year and down 3% quarter over quarter. Google sites CPCs were down 13% year over year and down 3% quarter over quarter.
Network paid clicks were down 12% year over year and up 4% quarter over quarter. And network CPCs were up 2% year over year and down 11% quarter over quarter.
As you know, we don't usually break down the impact of the individual factors on the quarterly changes in our clicks and CPCs. But this quarter, I want to provide more color on what's happening within our Sites clicks and the CPC metrics so that you can better understand the dynamics of the underlying businesses that drive them.
Many commentators have incorrectly assumed that the growth trends in our sites clicks and CPCs are primarily due to difficulties monetizing search on mobile. But that's, in fact, not the case. Remember that sites metrics include clicks and revenues related to ads served on Google's owned and operated properties, most notably, obviously, Google.com. But, as well, YouTube engagement ads like TrueView where a users choice not to skip an add is counted as a click.
While over the past year we've seen YouTube viewership climb dramatically, both in established markets but also due to rapid expansion in emerging markets. And quality improvements in TrueView ads mean that more users are, in fact, choosing not to skip them, increasing the overall ad view. So, this means that there is much higher volume of TrueView ads being seen, which has been a significant driver of year-over-year growth in numbers that you seeing in Site clicks.
TrueView ads currently monetize at lower rates than ad clicks on Google.com. But, as you know, video ads generally reach people earlier in the purchase funnel, and so across the industry, they tend to have a very different pricing profile than they would have on a typical performance search ad. Excluding the impact of YouTube TrueView ads, growth in Site clicks would be lower but still positive, and our CPCs would be healthy and growing year over year.
So, really we have two positive stories to tell here today. First, as I mentioned earlier, we are experiencing real strength in mobile search, and the CPCs in our core search business is continuing to grow year over year. So, it's doing very well.
Second, viewership in YouTube videos and TrueView ads are growing significantly. And YouTube's contribution to our advertising revenue continues to grow at a strong rate year over year. And we're really pleased with how the YouTube business is progressing. So that's the story.
Turning to geographic performance, you'll see in our earnings slides would you can find on our Investor Relations website, you'll see that we've broken down our revenue by US, UK and rest of world, and show the impact of FX and the benefits from our hedging program. So, please refer to those slides for the exact calculations.
Despite the large currency headwinds I mentioned, we saw solid performance for our core advertising business all around the world. The US was up 11% year over year to $7.4 billion, the UK was up 6% year over year to $1.7 billion, and in fixed FX terms, the UK actually grew 12% year over year. Our non-US revenue, which excluding the UK, was up 14% year over year to $8.2 billion, accounting for 47% of our total revenue. And in fixed FX terms the rest of the world grew a solid 24% year over year.
Now let me turn to expenses. Traffic acquisition costs were $3.3 billion for the quarter or 22% of total advertising revenue. Our non-GAAP other cost of revenue was $2.9 billion in Q1, which excludes SBC. Our non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $5.4 billion, again, excluding stock-based compensation. As a result of non-GAAP operating profit was a healthy $5.7 billion and non-GAAP operating margin 33% in Q1.
Headcount was up just over 1,800 people in Q1. In total, we ended the quarter with approximately 55,400 full-time employees at Google. Our effective tax rate was 22% for Q1.
Let me now turn to cash management. Other income and expenses was $157 million. Interest income and realized gains on investments offset the continued impact of expenses from our FX hedging program. For more details on OI&E please do refer to the slides that accompany this call on our website.
We're pleased with our strong operating cash flow at $6.6 billion. CapEx for the quarter was $2.9 billion. This quarter most CapEx spent was related to, first, product production equipment, data center construction, and facilities, in that order. Clearly our computing capacity is a strategic asset for us and that's why we're investing in it.
But we innovate there just like we do everywhere else. To give you an example, compared to five years ago we can now deliver more than three times as much compute power for the same amount of power or money.
Our free cash flow for the quarter was $3.7 billion. So, once again, strong results, in the core business as evidenced by our 17% fixed FX revenue growth this quarter and solid margin.
Now I'd like to turn it to Omid to provide you more specifics on our successful performance of our core and new businesses, and then we will turn it over to questions. Omid?

Omid Kordestani,  Google Inc. - Chief Business Officer    [4]

          Thank you, Patrick. Our teams turned in a great performance across our business this quarter. I thought I would switch up our typical format a bit this time around. I'll quickly share some highlights and then I want to talk more about growth areas that we are really focused on -- mobile and branding.
Let's start with the rise of programmatic ad buying. It's an extraordinary change for the ads industry. And I want to point out that our investments in the DoubleClick platform continue to be a big positive for us.
We recently made TrueView our skippable ad format on YouTube, available through our DoubleClick suite. And we brought Internet delivered TV content to our ad exchange through mDialogue, a company we acquired last year.
Google Play is also growing fast, connecting developers and content providers with more than 1 billion people on Android devices around the world. Developers are building thriving businesses on our platform. And in February we announced that over the past 12 months, we've paid more than $7 billion to developers. We are honored to be partnering with them.
Our partner hardware ecosystem is also doing great, LG Watch Urbane. And Huawei watch recently announced new Android wear devices and Pioneer launched in-dash car units compatible with Android auto. Also, 10 top computer OEMs are now making more than 35 Chrome devices available in 38 countries, which is a great momentum for us.
Google for Work continues to grow at an impressive pace, thanks to the addition of customers like G4S, one of the world's largest private-sector employers, who moved 70,000 of their employees to Drive for Work. Working with our partners, we also recently launched Android for Work to accelerate the adoption of Android devices in the workplace. Business is going great in these areas and we continue to invest and capture the potential we see for growth.
Now I want to talk more about the two areas where I see a lot of opportunity for us. First, the shift to mobile and then the trend of TV budgets shifting to digital.
Mobile devices are driving a huge shift in the way people consume media. You've heard about the trends many times. Here is our point of view.
As we all know, consumers reach for their phones a lot and some of these moments matter more than others, like when people are looking for answers, or making a decision about what to buy or do. For example, more than 8 in 10 smartphone users use their phone to research a product decision they are about to make in-store. These moments include small things like looking for a movie review, and really big decisions like researching a new home purchase or figuring out what car you want to buy next. So, people expect to get exactly what they want when they want it.
As a company built on intent and immediacy, that's good news for Google. Our job has always been to connect people with what they are looking for in the exact moment they are looking.
Our ads products are a critical way we deliver the right answers in the right moment, and it's something we do really well. It's often more valuable to know someone is shopping for a new SUV, than it is to know basic demographic information about them. We have great opportunities in mobile with some of the most popular mobile apps including the Google apps, YouTube, Gmail, and Maps and our great Android platform.
Search is also important to the mobile experience. We have a retooled our search engine for mobile, providing direct answers and enabling voice queries. It's really a delightful experience. Try opening the Google apps and asking what's the plot of the Godfather movie or flip a coin. You'll be pleasantly surprised.
Chrome for mobile is also a popular app with more than 400 million users. And of course a large number of people use it as a primary way to search the web. We continue to invest in improving the mobile web for both users and developers. In our recent Chrome release we made it easier for users to add their favorite sites to their phone home screens and get helpful opt-in notifications from sites they visit often.
We've also been working to index apps just as effectively as we index web content. We now have 30 billion links within apps indexed. And if you're looking for information that lives within an app that you don't have, we will now begin showing links to install the app right under the search results page. The Google app on Android can also keep you up to date by surfacing information from more than 40 different apps when it is relevant, like Pandora music recommendations on your commute or a car to request a lift when you arrive at the airport.
We're also working very hard to make our products more accessible to the next billion people who are coming online. The first computer experience for these users won't be on a desktop machine or a laptop. They will be on a mobile phone from day one. In fact, many of them will use a mobile device as their only computer.
We launched Android One, a new family of high-quality, low-cost smartphones in Indonesia and the Philippines this quarter, making it available in a total of six emerging markets. We're also working to eliminate the barriers to access from conductivity issues. For instance, in countries like India, where a user might have a slow wireless connection, we can deliver a fast-loading light version of search so they can get their answers quickly and pay less for data.
And with the Chrome app for Android and IOS, our data compression features help reduce data usage by up to 50% while browsing the web. There's tremendous upside to these efforts and we're in a great position.
I'm also very excited about how we are helping marketers succeed in this mobile world. As I noted earlier, we're connecting brands with the right people at the precise moment when it actually matters because of our strong intent signals.
Mobile also enables us to help drive the 90% of commerce that still takes place off-line, which is a massive opportunity that our partners are really excited about. People are searching on Google for things like near me, closest, and nearby, twice as much as they did last year. Our local inventory ads are a great way for businesses to drive purchases in-store right when people are looking for local options.
We also help advertisers better measure the store visits that their digital ads drive, and we recently expanded the capabilities to advertisers in new countries. Our ads are also driving people to download apps precisely when they're looking for them. Our AdMob mobile ad network offers great targeting and reach and is the foundation of our app install offerings.
Last month, we also introduced app promotion video ads, and extended app install ads to our mobile Google Display network, which increased installed volumes for early testers by an average of 28% without impacting cost per install. We also recently began testing sponsored search results in Google Play with a small set of users and developers, helping app developers reach valuable users directly within the store.
So I'm very excited about the mobile future and marketers are, too. Our pivot to mobile has great momentum and it's delivering strong benefits to users and advertisers.
I also feel very excited about the trend of video content and TV budgets shifting to digital. YouTube is the world's most popular video service, on all screens with hundreds of millions of hours watched on YouTube every day. The place where 1 billion people come to watch video is a natural home for video advertising budgets.
When people come to YouTube, they come with the intent of watching video, so it's the perfect time to reach them with a video ad, not when they're distracted by something else. More and more brands are seeing the value of reaching audiences on YouTube, too, with the number of TrueView advertisers growing by 45% in 2014.
YouTube drives great results and we can measure the impact. We have run over 6,000 brand lift studies to date across some of the largest brand advertisers. And in studies we have run for Google preferred campaigns, we found that 94% of the campaigns we studied drove a significant lift, an average of 80% in ad recall. That's why we're bringing it back this year and expanding it to more than 10 new markets.
Google Preferred is also attracting some of the biggest TV advertisers to YouTube. More than 30 major brands that have never advertised on YouTube before signed on with Google preferred and saw such great results that they have continued to advertise with YouTube afterwards. YouTube is home to great content and engaged audiences and we are seeing the natural shift of TV budgets.
So, those are some of my observations on the trends affecting our business, what I'm hearing from partners, and why I'm upbeat on the opportunities ahead. You'll see a lot more at our Brandcast upfront event in New York next week, at the AdWords Performance Summit in early May, and our I/O developer conference in late May. We look forward to seeing you there.
Before I go, I want to thank all of the Googlers worldwide for a great quarter. And I want to say special thank you to Patrick who has been our fearless CFO for almost seven years, and who wrote one of the most heartfelt and awesome retirement notes I've ever seen. If you've read it, you'll know that he was inspired to move on after climbing Mount Kilimanjaro. I have since banned travel to Kilimanjaro for all Googlers, recommending local hills near their home. Patrick, you'll be dearly missed and we wish you and your wife all the best on your next adventure.
Thank you. And, Ruth, if you're out there listening, we can't begin to wait working with you soon. Thank you.

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc. - CFO    [5]

          Thank you, Omid. And absolutely true for Ruth, as well. Candace, why don't you give us the instructions to turn on the Q&A?


Questions and Answers

Carlos Kirjner, Bernstein.

Carlos Kirjner,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. - Analyst    [2]

          Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two questions. First, our research has suggested that many or maybe most mobile websites and mobile apps are still in pretty bad shape when it comes to user experience and conversion. I think one can expect this to improve over time/. The question is, is an improvement in conversion rate and experiences within mobile apps where users transact good or bad for Google? One could argue that people are going to spend more time in apps, transacting apps, and not search. How should we think about that?
Secondly, it's been more than two years when we've seen capital intensity very high. It continues to be quite high with $2.9 billion of CapEx. Is this the new normal? Is that what we should expect going forward? Thank you.

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc. - CFO    [3]

          Omid, do you want to take the first one and I'll take the second one?

Omid Kordestani,  Google Inc. - Chief Business Officer    [4]

          Sure. Thank you, Carlos, for the question. We're actually very excited about improvements of these mobile websites. We really are happy to see where we can deliver the best answers to our users, whether be it through an app or whether we find it on the web.
We're working with developers, webmasters, publishers to help them really surface their content to users in a format they feel best. We also recently introduced this install app, install carousel, which is evidence of that effort. So, it's really about delivering the right results to the users, and the less friction you have there and the more targeted you are, we'll see the benefits in monetization.

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc. - CFO    [5]

          On our side, Carlos, on the CapEx side, we are far from surprised from these numbers internally. Part of our plan. We are shifting, as you know, we've been building a lot of data centers over the last 18 months. So that is actually giving us the opportunity to put in new equipment. And we're jumping on the opportunity, thinking to the total cost of ownership of these things and the much more higher efficiency of these new machines.
Having said that, I won't comment about the future, but I just want to re-emphasize that we were not surprised by these numbers. To us, actually, they make sense given our strategy, and they were really fuel all the innovation we have going for us. It is an important part of our strategy. It's a strategic asset.
Thanks, Carlos for your questions. Candace, let's go to our next question, please.

Operator    [6]

          Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets.

Mark Mahaney,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [7]

          Thanks, Patrick, thanks for all the additional color on the paid clicks and the CPCs. Just so we step back a little bit, because there were many of us who thought it really was driven mostly by mobile. Is your point, is your assertion that these real major shifts that we've seen over the last two or three years in CPC pressure has really largely been driven by YouTube TrueViews and the adoption of that? Is that the point you're making?
In the past you always listed the factors that would cause the shifts in paid clicks and CPCs. Could you just check off what the other items are and put them in order of priority what's moving those two needles? Thank you.

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc. - CFO    [8]

          Mark, thank you for your question. And, in fact, that's why I made the comments I made today. I'm just talking about the situation as we have it now. I'm not looking back to the prior years.
I'm just saying what we have seen in this quarter, in the last quarter, we've just seen a real acceleration at YouTube. And that's why we thought it was important, because we saw this change, from the fundamental strong performance of YouTube, both in terms of its coverage, in terms of the performance.
Like even the TrueView ads, we  tune these ads to make sure that people want to watch them so that they are very effective. And when they do, then people watch a lot more of them.
Over the last quarter, over the last couple of quarters, we've seen a real takeoff, and then the geographic expansion is giving us a lot more coverage. So, it's a real positive story for YouTube. Because we see it now we're reporting it now, so it's not a view back to the last five years at all. I just wanted to clarify that. So, thank you for your question.

Operator    [9]

          Douglas Anmuth, JPMorgan.

Douglas Anmuth,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [10]

          Thanks for taking the question. Omid, I was hoping you could drill down a little bit more on the mobile search changes that are taking place, talk a little bit more about what you think the key factors are here and the key differences, and how that will impact both the natural results and also monetization.
And then, Patrick, just on the margins on cost in the quarter, non-GAAP operating margins basically flat from a year ago. Just trying to understand how much you think that was a factor of one-time items a year ago, or a change at all in terms of your view on cost discipline within the business. Thanks.

Omid Kordestani,  Google Inc. - Chief Business Officer    [11]

          Thanks, Douglas. With mobile phones really becoming such a primary way people search the Net, our goal is really to help people search, find the content that's not just relevant and timely but also really easy to read and interact with on these smaller devices and smaller screens. It's important to note that this is just one of over 200 signals we use to evaluate the best results. Non-mobile friendly sites won't disappear from the mobile searches, they'll still rank high if they hold great content that the user wants.
But a lack of mobile friendliness is a problem for web publishers because there is a band on the websites, and that's a real issue. So, it's really early to speculate exactly how the monetization impacts of these organic algorithm changes will be. But we always start with the user to deliver the right answer, the best answer, be it on the mobile web or the app. And we think that ultimately that's good for publishers, advertisers and our users, and the monetization success will follow.

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc. - CFO    [12]

          Douglas, on my side, if you look at it, we're really pleased with Q1. If you look at the operating profit of the country, despite Q4 to Q1 revenue trends that are always seasonal, delivered essentially the same $5.7 billion of non-GAAP operating profits for the quarter. So, we really focused on our sequential performance rather than what happened a year ago. And there was no real specific one-time items for this quarter. This was just a pretty clean quarter and we're pretty happy with it.
Thank you, Douglas, for your question. Candace, let's go to our next question, please.

Operator    [13]

          Brian Nowak, Morgan Stanley.

Brian Nowak,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [14]

          Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just to go back to your comments on splitting YouTube out from the CPC then paid clicks, you mentioned paid click growth would be lower excluding YouTube. Would you be willing to just help us understand that growth rate, what it looks like now and what it looked like a year ago. And then on the CPCs, you mentioned search CPCs continue to grow. Is that true even including the migration to emerging markets where CPCs are lower and even the shift toward mobile?

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc. - CFO    [15]

          What I wanted to do today is clarify the issue between YouTube and our dot-com properties rather than to go into all the details. You've seen in my notes, in my comments, that the impact of TrueView ads and site CPCs, site CPCs would be growing if you take out the TrueView ad impact. And I've also noted that mobile search is continuing on the path of strength.
So, from that perspective, what I wanted to make sure is that you get the color that if you just exclude the great growth of YouTube, but it has very different fundamental dynamics, that the core of what is typically search performance, both on mobile and desktop, the combined, is doing really good. And the CPCs would be growing if you take the other effect out.
That's really what I want to make sure, so that people don't continue to hound on this issue of it's all about mobile that has terrible monetization. In fact, it's a good story there, too. Thank you for your question.

          Ben Schachter, Macquarie.

Ben Schachter,  Macquarie Research - Analyst    [17]

          First, Patrick, congratulations on a great run at Google, and enjoy the future bike rides. A couple questions. Can you talk about how you think Google Wallet needs to evolve to better compete with Apple Pay and others? Are we going to see acquisitions in that space or will it be more organic?
And, the, Patrick, any updated thoughts on how Google is viewing its cash balances? Are you going to return some of that cash before you leave? Thanks.

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc. - CFO    [18]

          The easier answer is really for Omid, so I'll let him take that one and then I'll talk about the cash issues.

Omid Kordestani,  Google Inc. - Chief Business Officer    [19]

          On Apple Pay, I think it's just that the -- we really want to see that the industry is really opening up here and that the merchants, the banks, consumers are all starting to experience this. And our focus is really to bring this set of new APIs for payments, called Android Pay. And that our goal has always been to remove much of the friction that our users encounter today on everyday shopping experiences.
So, we are excited about what the industry is doing here and what the user's option is going to be. And we're working with all the partners to just put all of the pieces together and finally create the momentum that we are all looking forward to benefit from.

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc. - CFO    [20]

          And on my side, Ben, I have no news on the cash issue. I'll just reiterate what I've said many times because I think not only is a true but it's important -- that we do bring this issue to the attention of the audit committee, the Board. There are regular debates about this issue. And it's a balance between cash being the strategic asset. And then the question we ask ourselves also in our conversations and deliberations is, do we have a pipeline of opportunities that would make us believe that we would actually wisely invest this kind of money. And in that sense, it's very clear that we're having the debates, we continue, but we have no further updates for you on that issue.

Ben Schachter,  Macquarie Research - Analyst    [21]

          Thank you.

          Heather Bellini, Goldman Sachs.

Heather Bellini,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [23]

          Great, thank you for the question and congratulations, Patrick. I just wanted to follow up on your YouTube comments earlier. You talked about the growth you've been seeing in particular over the last couple quarters. I'm just wondering, when you are talking to advertisers, what's changed over the last year or so that you really think has caused this acceleration in click volume that you're seeing? And how do you think about that gap and the potential for that gap to close over time with what you see in just traditional site CPCs, if you will? Thank you.

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc. - CFO    [24]

          I'll take the technical side of it and then I'll let Omid give you a bit more on the color of what's exciting at YouTube. Related to the question, and the answer I gave you, the comments I gave you today, it's really about, if you think about it, about coverage rather than what's the new product. Because we've done a lot of geographic expansion of YouTube and that in itself gives you a lot more volume out there in terms of eyeballs.
And then in addition to that, we've, through the great work of the team and the AdWords team and the YouTube team, the monetization team, making sure that a TrueView is a more efficient product where people, basically they actually do watch the entire ad, and so they don't skip the 4 to 5 seconds. And all you need is a -- given the scale of YouTube today, all you need is to have a product that people want more, and it actually delivers a lot more value in terms of advertising total revenue.
The fact that it's at the top of the funnel clearly has very different dynamics than when you have a very specific performance-based ad that is tied to a very specific high margin query. But that doesn't mean that it's not incredibly useful for advertisers because that's where they start is at the top of the funnel.
These are all of the pieces of the puzzle that we have going for us. And for what's really exciting about YouTube I'll let Omid give you more color comment on this.

Omid Kordestani,  Google Inc. - Chief Business Officer    [25]

          Hi, Heather. First of all, invite you to come to BrandCast next week. I'll be there in New York and you'll get a sense of the momentum in YouTube. But, really, the way we look at it is, as usual, first look at the users. One-third of all people on the Internet are every day watching hundreds of millions of hours on YouTube and this is generating billions of views.
And then when we look at our advertisers, they want to be there. So, we're seeing strong growth in TrueView with new advertisers. The number grew 45% in 2014. And all of the top 100 global brands have run TrueView ads over the past year.
As they're experiencing success, for example, with Google Preferred -- I think I shared this data earlier -- but 95% of the Preferred campaigns that we study drove a significant lift, an average of 80%. And then more than 30 brands that were new to advertising on YouTube used Google Preferred and then came back and continued to advertise with us afterward. So, just having great success.

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc. - CFO    [26]

          Heather, it's a good story all around. We're pretty pleased by it, obviously. Thank you for your question. Candace, we'll go to our next question, please.

Eric Sheridan,  UBS - Analyst    [28]

          Thanks for taking the questions. And I'll echo the sentiment -- congrats, Patrick, on the decision, and best of luck going forward. My question is more around mobile. I appreciated all the color around the clicks and the CPCs.
But, Omid, maybe you could talk a little bit either qualitatively or quantitatively about the way in which mobile advertising, especially search, is evolving over time, and whether some of the gaps that we used to talk about one or two years ago are starting to close in terms of monetization, whether it be dictated by screen sizes or people getting more comfortable, or maybe some of the changes you will be making around mobile search with some of the ranking that we've seen gone into effect this week. I would love to get some color about how you've seen mobile evolve and how you see it evolve going forward. Thanks.

Omid Kordestani,  Google Inc. - Chief Business Officer    [29]

          Sure, let me just give you some thoughts. Again, thank you for this. We're very excited about this pivot to mobile. And it's really obviously a shift that started gradually and it's been very dramatic for us. If you talk to every product manager at Google and leader at Google, they have it at the forefront of their thoughts on how to delight the users, how to improve the experience. Same thing on our advertising front.
So, one is obviously the efforts we're doing for the discovery, the search for information, be it in the apps or be it on mobile web. The other aspect of this that is really going to help us obviously with the monetization front is the improvements in measurement -- measuring across devices, measuring in-store sales. And, as you know, the shopping experience becomes more powerful because users can find this information, they can find it with local products.
It doesn't become just about driving leads to online retailers, it's about driving traffic to off-line storage via mobile. And we're seeing great adoption from retailers -- from Macy's, REI, Sears.
The way we're going to talk about this, and you are going to hear us talk more about this, is this intent and immediacy that we are so good at, given our heritage in search. And we're just applying all of that knowledge and all of the experience we have an ads and search to improving these mobile experiences and how we monetize. Thank you.

          Anthony DiClemente.

Anthony DiClemente,   - Analyst    [31]

          How are you, Patrick? Congratulations and best wishes on your next endeavors. A couple questions. First I want to ask about Maps and Waze. It seems to me like those are very strategic assets, assets and businesses where Google has a competitive advantage. Can you just talk about the progress and the user experiences with Maps and the opportunity going forward for the contribution to the business from those platforms?
And then, secondly, Patrick, given your telecom background, can you just please describe for us the strategy around the Project Fi that was announced this week? How does that connect back to the other Google access initiatives like Google Fiber? And maybe just talk about the longer-term vision there. Thanks.

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc. - CFO    [32]

          Great. Do you want to jump in first?

Omid Kordestani,  Google Inc. - Chief Business Officer    [33]

          Yes, sure. This is Omid. Thank you, Anthony, for the question. On the Maps, we absolutely agree with you -- very strategic, very popular. And that there are more than 1 billion monthly active users of the Google map services.
We have mapped the world, as you know, 200 countries and territories, including North Korea. 1 billion times the app has been downloaded on Android. And lots and lots of stats that I can go through.
And I think one of the things that we're doing is not only to improve that experience and integrate it as much as it makes sense to throughout the services, and whenever users can take advantage of those signals in the proper response from Google. But the other side of this is also partnering. One of the things we're really actively doing is partnering, getting our map service in native formats with as many partners out there that can take advantage of it.
It's an area we are really investing in. We're very excited about it. It's having great traction and we are also happy to offer it to our partners. And you'll see us, both in terms of Maps and Waze, you will see it getting integrated in other popular web services out there.

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc. - CFO    [34]

          Great. On my side, there's quite a different rationale, if you think of Fi versus Access which is really asset-based. As a reminder, some of you may have heard, we just announced Fi yesterday so it's still very early days. It's focused on innovating in connectivity and communications, but in close partnerships with carriers in the US -- hardware makers.
We're trying to see, again from a user perspective and from a service perspective, with or without assets, what should look like the next wave of innovation. If you're always looking to make the web faster, cheaper, more available, and we wanted to try this new vision, this new idea of a fast and easy wireless service. And then work with the ecosystem of our carriers -- so, that's why we have T-Mobile and Sprint as launch carriers -- and manufacturers and developers to develop this kind of new product, new and innovative service.
So, different in the sense that, Anthony, in the case of fiber, in the case of Loon, it's really asset-based; this one is really about services and how can we use today's platforms to actually just drive for more innovation. So, that's really the difference. But we're pretty excited. It'll be interesting to see the take rate and it'll be interesting to see how the market response is to it. But, again, very much as usual, focused on innovation, focused on pushing the envelope. Thanks for your question.

          Stephen Ju, Credit Suisse.

Stephen Ju,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [36]

          Patrick, bon voyage and best of luck with everything. I'm trying to get some sense of the direction of costs involved in running YouTube. Granted, there's the revenue share components, the content owners, but then there's the everyday operating costs involving just running the business, like engineers, bandwidth, et cetera. So, I'm wondering at this point, what part of YouTube's cost base is variable and what part is fixed, because it seems like your revenue is now large enough to cover the costs to serve a user, as the cost in the aggregate is probably not growing as rapidly as revenue.
And, additionally, even as we adjust for the reclassification of DoubleClick to network, the [L&O] line decelerated a bit more than we thought. So I'm just wondering if this is just due to Play indexing higher against those countries, that saw the highest amount of FX headwinds. Or did you have some sort of hardware shortage issues this quarter also? Thanks.

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc. - CFO    [37]

          Let's start with the last one first and then I'll come back to YouTube. On other revenues, what you have in there is, yes, you're right that we have the re-class. And then on the two other factors, clearly Play is going really well. But it is also hit by quite strong headwinds. So, we're very pleased with the performance of Play, but given that it has quite a large international skew, it also gets hit by headwinds of FX, as well.
And then on the hardware side, no shortage this quarter, so no shortage issues versus the 4 to 6. So, that's been performing quite well. But, again, when you look at year-over-year comparisons for hardware, then last year we had the new Nexus 7 tablet that was very popular. Then you have a bit of noise on the comparisons year over year. So, you have the combination of these three things that are flowing through the line, so that's why you end up with that kind of performance. But what's most important is FX-adjusted we continue to be very pleased with the Play growth.
On YouTube, interestingly -- obviously we don't divulge any of the details of what's fixed and what's variable and any of this -- but what I can tell you is we actually monitor the performance of YouTube for its profitability to make sure that it continues to grow profitably. And we basically manage with Susan to reinvest at the right pace, if you wish. So, fueling the growth where it is showing up, and keeping tight in areas where we need more efficiencies.
That's how we manage. I've said this in the past, I'll say it again -- if you just want to make YouTube profitable tomorrow morning it's very easy. You put on the brakes on growth and then it just turns into a profitable business. We continue to work that tension where Susan has the carrot of as much profitability I can generate, I can reinvest at a certain pace, so it creates a great incentive for this growth and disciplined behavior that we have there. So, we're pretty pleased by it. Thank you so much for your question, Stephen. Candace?

Ross Sandler,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [39]

          Great. I just had two quick follow-ups from the last question and then one for Nikesh. Patrick, on the operating margin question, given the increased discipline you talked about last call, do you think this flat margin is sustainable in 2015? And if not what would cause it to drop back down year on year?
And then, from the prior questions, this new other revenue line was up like 23% in the quarter, I think it was like 19% or 20% last quarter. So, surprising at the accelerations in there given the FX trends. Can you just talk about, is that Google Play or is that hardware between those two?
And then Nikesh, there's been some talk of Google introducing custom audience products for AdWords. Is that something you are willing to talk about? And how big of a targeting feature like that could be in terms of improving our lives and increasing spend in search?

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc. - CFO    [40]

          Ross, on my side, two points. One is on the issue of margin, you know we don't give guidance, so I can't pronounce myself for the rest of 2015. But I think that in Q1 you see a good example of what we talked about when we had our comments in Q4, which is we drive for that right balance -- that right balance of you want to fuel as much as possible, responsibly, the growth that we have in the areas where we want to invest, and in other areas we may decide that actually [we really torque] for efficiencies all the time.
You see that in our Q1 results. In fact, I didn't mention it but just a note on the headcount, the vast majority of headcount for Q1 is in fact engineers and product managers. It's not G&A, it's not sales, it's really focused on engineering because that's where we wanted to put the emphasis. I'm using this as an example of, even though the numbers are large in a number of areas, there is actually a lot of science applied to every one of these numbers to make sure that we continue to drive for high efficiencies as much as we can.
You may have heard that in Q1, we've canceled another program that we had which was the helpouts. This program did not prove the promises that we had for it, and so we actually repurposed the team and shut down the entire initiative.
Again, I'm just giving you the signal that this is a disciplined organization that looks at the facts, that actually when it's not working people can sense it and then we have a good conversation about it. And then on the other side, when we see something really going well, we want to make sure that we push hard for it.
In the case of the second piece that you've asked, which was the growth in other revenue, I think Play is doing very well. We are very happy about that. And, yes, we're having good results on the Nexus 6 but year over year it wasn't as strong as what had given the strength of the Nexus 7 last year. So, that's really been that big driver.
And as for Nikesh, Nikesh, I heard, is on his way to India right now. He was on a plane. But I have Omid here who will be delighted to answer your question.

Ross Sandler,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [41]

          I'm sorry about that.

Omid Kordestani,  Google Inc. - Chief Business Officer    [42]

          No problem. People confuse us. On these rumors about custom audiences, we are very much focused on completing this cycle of better targeting and measurement attribution at all points of the funnel with our different products. We're not announcing any new products at this point, but we have a great number of targeting options, interest, intent, location across all the services, from performance to brand. And I think you will see us innovate here, and continue to innovate here. Thank you.

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc. - CFO    [43]

          Thank you, Russ. And I didn't mean to pick on you. We all trip over Nikesh and Omid all the time. He's used to it.

Ross Sandler,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [44]

          I put down Nikesh on my notes. Sorry about that.

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc. - CFO    [45]

          No worries. Candace, let's go to our next question please.

Operator    [46]

          Peter Stabler, Wells Fargo.

Peter Stabler,  Wells Fargo Securities - Analyst    [47]

          Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Patrick, thanks for all the color around the click information. It begs another question, though. Given the frequency with which a lot of us misinterpret these numbers, and given the growing importance of brand advertising, and the accompanying expansion of attribution and ROI modeling to measure impact beyond simple clicks, I'm wondering if these metrics have outlived their usefulness, and whether you guys are considering a way to help us understand your success behind brand advertising going forward. Thanks very much.

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc. - CFO    [48]

          We look at this on a regular basis. We just happened to see on the YouTube side so much change in the last couple quarters that we thought it was worth mentioning. I think they've served us well. If we ever decide to look at different ways to look at the business and want to report it that way we will let you know. For now we have really no difference in changes in the way that we reported. So that's the short answer, Peter.
I think we have time for one last question so why don't we take one last question before we close the call? Candace?

Operator    [49]

          Mark May, Citi.

Mark May,  Citigroup - Analyst    [50]

          Thanks for taking my questions. There's a view out there that consumer behavior is different on mobile versus desktop in terms of search and web usage versus apps. I'm just wondering, are you seeing that from your users as they shift from the desktop to mobile devices? In essence, is the growth in mobile search activity offsetting the weakness that you may be seeing in desktop search?
And then second question is just on verticals by advertiser verticals. We had heard some data points during the quarter around potentially some weakness in the e-commerce category. Just wondering if you could comment a little bit on maybe some verticals where you saw particular strength and weakness. Thanks.

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc. - CFO    [51]

          Thank you, Mark, for the question. Let me just take the vertical one first. In terms of performance we definitely saw automotive and travel were stronger verticals this quarter. India was a strong performer as far as the geo goes for us. And those are really some of the areas that I could highlight.
And I think in terms of this behavior change, we are really focused on studying it every day. The shift is very dramatic. And that we are laser-focused on being as good and relevant and fast and monetized well-- all the things that we did on the desktop and continue to do on the desktop to do that on mobile.
I think all I can say on that is you are right, behaviors are different. There's this immediacy, having this device always with you, using it as your assistant, using your voice to make commands and getting results, using the maps, and being in a moment of purchase decision and relying on this information source to help you. So, all of those things are really powerful and we are very excited about it. It's a journey that we are all on and looking forward to doing a better job and monetizing well. So, thank you, Mark for your question.
Before I close, allow me just 10 seconds. First, Ruth will join us in about a month. We're really excited to have her. I will be here to help her in transition. But you'll hear a much better voice in Q2 on the earnings call. We're really looking forward to having her as part of the team.
It obviously has been a delight to work at Google for the last seven years. I have obviously three thanks, three huge thanks for that.
The first one is to the Google community. As Omid mentioned all of these Googlers are simply extraordinary individuals and people, these men and women. They just continue to develop this stream of innovation that is really changing the world and making it a better place. So, it's been a real joy to work with every one of them.
My colleagues around this table, the IR team, as well as the executive group that I have spent many hours over the years. They're mostly friends now, so thank you for your friendship and all of your warmth over the last few years.
Then finally, you, the financial community, our shareholders. You've been supportive, you've been probing, you've had the insights, you've been really with us for the last seven years through thick and thin, as we have seen a lot of stuff come and go. And really a strong supporters for this a bit crazy, unconventional company. So I just need to thank you, as well, for all the great times together.
With that, yes, I am going to grab my backpack and take off for the world. So, you may see me somewhere in the world and if you do just please do stop and say hi. It would be a delight to see you.
So with that, I'll let Candace close the call. Thank you so much and we'll see you -- or Ruth will see you -- in Q2. Cheers.
