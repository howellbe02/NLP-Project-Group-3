Presentation
Operator    [1]

          Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Google Inc. second-quarter 2014 earnings conference call. This call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Jane Penner, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am. 

Jane Penner,  Google Inc. - Director of IR    [2]

          Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Google's second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With us are Patrick Pichette, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Nikesh Arora, Senior Vice President and Chief Business Officer. 
Also as you know, we distribute our Earnings Release through our Investor Relations website located at investor.Google.com. Please refer to our IR website for our Earnings Releases as well as the supplementary slides that accompany the call. You can also visit our Google+ Investor Relations page for the latest Company new and updates. Please check it out. 
This call is also being Webcast from investor.Google.com. A replay of the call will be available on our website later today. 
Now, let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding Google's future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses, and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. 
Please note that these forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation, and we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Please refer to our SEC filings for a more detailed description of the risk factors that may affect our results. 
Please note that certain financial measures that we use on this call such as operating income and operating margin are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude charges related to stock-based compensation and restructuring. We have also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capital expenditures which we refer to as free cash flow. Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Patrick. 

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [3]

          Thank you, Jane. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our second-quarter 2014 earnings call. 
So, I'll dive right into the numbers. Nikesh is going to give you a business update. Then, we'll open up for Q&A. Let's dive into the details of our financial performance for Q2. 
Our gross total consolidated revenue grew a healthy 22% year-over-year to $16 billion and was up 3% quarter-over-quarter. Without currency fluctuations, our gross total consolidated revenue growth would have in fact been 21% year-over-year, still very healthy. Our Google Site revenue was up 23% year-over-year to $10.9 billion and was up 4% quarter-over-quarter driven by strength in our core search advertising business. 
Our network revenue was up 7% year-over-year at $3.4 billion and was up 1% quarter-over-quarter driven by year-over-year growth in our ad mob and ad exchange businesses. Finally, Google other revenue grew 53% year-over-year to $1.6 billion and was up 3% quarter-over-quarter. Digital sales of apps and content in our Play store drove the year-over-year growth. 
Our global aggregate paid click was strong this quarter, up 25% year-over-year and 2% quarter-over-quarter. Aggregate CPC were down 6% year-over-year but flat quarter-over-quarter. And, without currency fluctuation, aggregate cost-per-click would have been down 7% year-over-year, so currency had a very minimal -- currency had no impact on quarter-over-quarter CPC growth. 
As we indicated in our last earnings call, we're now disclosing paid clicks and cost-per-click changes by property type in addition to aggregate numbers. So, to that end, Google Site's paid clicks were up 33% year-over-year and up 6% quarter-over-quarter. Our Google Site's CPC were down 7% year-over-year and down 2% quarter-over-quarter. 
On the network side, network paid clicks were up 9% year-over-year and down 5% quarter-over-quarter. And, our network CPCs were down 13% year-over-year and up 3% quarter-over-quarter. 
Our monetization metrics continue to be impacted by a number of factors at an aggregate level including geographic mix, device mix, property mix, as well as our ongoing product and policy changes.  And, since we're now disclosing additional property metrics related to our monetization, it may be helpful to remind you all of what we include in each property. So, let's start with sites. 
Sites monetization metrics include-ads that were served on Google-owned and operated properties across different geographies and form factors. These properties include YouTube search.  Obviously, YouTube engagement ads like true view and then other owned-operated properties such as maps or finance and otherwise. Our network monetization metrics include ad serves on non-Google properties participating in our AdSense per search, AdSense for content, and AdMob businesses. 
We also provide corresponding historical data since Q1 of 2013 for reference which can be found in our earnings slides. Nikesh and I will obviously be happy to respond as usual to your question about our Q2 monetization in the Q&A today. But, I'm sure that some of you may have detailed questions about monetization trends from prior quarters and to help you with that, the IR team will be ready to answer your questions after the call. 
Turning to geographic performance. We saw solid performance in the US and the UK and continued strong performance in Rest of World. In our earnings slides, which you can find on our Investor Relations website, you'll see that we've broken down our revenue by US, UK, and Rest of World, to show the impact of FX and the benefits of our hedging program. So, please do refer to these slides for the exact calculations. 
The US revenue was up 12% year-over-year to $6.6 billion. The UK was up 22% to $1.6 billion. And, in fixed FX terms, the UK grew 15% year-over-year, a clear improvement from last quarter's performance. 
As we mentioned in previous quarters, our AdSense for search business skews toward the US and the UK. And, our ongoing user-focused product and policy changes have continued to have a clear impact on our revenue growth in these two geographies. 
Our non-US revenue, excluding the UK, was up 31% year-over-year to $7.7 billion, and this accounted for 48% of our total revenue which includes a $6 million benefit from our hedging program. So, in FX term, the Rest of World grew also 31% year-over-year. 
Let me now turn to expenses. Traffic acquisition costs were $3.3 billion, or 23% of total advertising revenue this quarter. Our non-GAAP other cost of revenue was $2.7 billion in Q2. This is excluding stock-based compensation. 
Our non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $4.8 billion, again, excluding SBC. And, as a result, our non-GAAP operating profit was $5.1 billion, and our non-GAAP operating margin stood at 32% in Q2. 
Headcount was up roughly 2,200 people in Q2 in the last 90 days, and in total, we ended the quarter with approximately 52,000 full-time employees. Please note the headcount does include approximately 3,500 full-time employees from the Motorola business. Our effective tax rate was 21% in Q2. Our tax rate this quarter was impacted by the continued mix shift of earnings between our domestic and international subsidiaries. 
Let me now turn to cash management. Our OI&E, or other income and expense, was $145 million for the quarter. Interest income and realized gains on investments offset the continued impact of expenses from our FX hedging program. And for more detail on OI&E, please refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR website. 
We continue to be happy with our strong operating cash flow at $5.6 billion. And, CapEx for the quarter was $2.6 billion. This quarter the majority of the CapEx spend was related to data center construction, real estate purchases, and finally, production equipment in that order. Investors should see our investment in CapEx as a positive signal since it reflects our sustained optimism about Google's business. 
As I've mentioned before, we'll continue to invest for the long term, and our infrastructure and real estates assets remain a key strategic area of investment for us. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $3 billion. 
Before I close, I want to give a brief update on Motorola. The team continues to be hard at work, and we look forward to seeing them join with the Lenovo team soon. Motorola had a great Q2 with the Moto E and Moto G both showing strong sales momentum, especially in emerging markets. 
So there you have it. Strong results and an optimism that provides us the confidence to continue to fund strategic growth opportunities in many areas including our CapEx area that we talked about earlier. 
And now, I'll let Nikesh cover some more details on our business performance in the quarter, and after his remarks, I'll take it back to open up the phone lines for questions. Here you go, Nikesh. 

Nikesh Arora,  Google Inc - SVP & Chief Business Officer    [4]

          Thank you, Patrick.  We've had an amazing last few month at Google.   Our focus in creating great multi-screen experiences is paying off. 
I hope you saw our annual IO development conference a few weeks ago. We were joined by over 6,000 developers in San Francisco along with approximately 1.9 million people globally tuning in online. We unveiled the upcoming Android L release.  We also showed how we're expanding the Android platform to cars, watches, TVs, as well as making it easy to search Google from anywhere by simply saying, okay Google. 
Making magical products that people love using every day is what drives our ambition and fuels our business. Last quarter, we saw strong growth with $16 billion in gross revenue. We saw particular strength in the travel and retail verticals, as well as in several countries like Japan and India. 
By now, you know the four areas driving our business. One, performance or direct response marketing. Two, helping clients build their brands. Three, our ad tech platforms for agencies and publishers. And four, our emerging businesses like digital content, enterprise, and hardware. 
I'll quickly go through each of them. This quarter, I want to highlight the investments we're making to serve small businesses. 
Firstly, in performance advertising. In the long term, we are battling towards a world where people jump seamlessly across screens of all sizes on all types of surfaces. In today's world, unlocking the mobile phone opportunity is absolutely key for every marketeer, and we're seeing tremendous amounts of momentum here. 
We've been building popular mobile app formats for years, like showcasing a business' location or click-to-call, et cetera. The team are laser-focused on making ad campaigns easier across screens and helping businesses measure their effectiveness across devices as well as offline. 
We already offer great solutions for marketeers wanting to promote app installs. In April at our AdWords performance forum, we super-charged our offerings for app developers across search, display, as well as YouTube. We launched improvements like app deep linking and search to help developers reengage users who have already downloaded their app, better targeting options in AdMob to help them reach the most likely customers, even a new app install format on YouTube, and more powerful measurement tools so they know exactly how their app is performing at every stage. 
Mobile hotel booking app hotel tonight uses mobile search ads as a key part of their global marketing efforts because it drives consistently high-value users who are more likely to purchase quickly in the apps. In fact, international mobile search campaigns drive three times higher conversion rates compared to other direct response channels. 
We are also seeing tremendous amounts of momentum in the retailer segment as a product listing ads across screens. In fact, this past quarter, we sent over three times as much traffic to merchants on smartphones and tablet devices compared to Q2 of last year. 
Moving on to the second area of brand building. I recently spent some time at ConLine Festival. I know it was working Con where Google had a big presence, hosting over 300 meetings with creative agency and brands. 
What was actually interesting this year was how much the conversation was brands has changed from years past. Whereas digital used to be just one channel, today's brands are putting digital at the center of the brand-building campaigns. We see this from our clients as well, and video seems to be the lynchpin of the strategy. 
YouTube continues to be driven by the insanely popular channels from some of our top content creators like Breakout Hit, Epic rap battles of history, and new sensation vice news. We launched our Google Preferred video offering at BrandCast in April, giving marketeers access to top content at YouTube, and we've gotten phenomenal amount of support from agencies and brands so far. Digitas was our first agency to sign on and since then Omnicom media Group has also pledged its support. Brands including General Motors, Coca-Cola, and universal pictures are also having tremendous amounts of success with Google Preferred. 
Adidas was one of the major brands to leverage our global platform to reach fans during the World Cup.  They engaged soccer fans by live streaming events with athletes, promoted them on YouTube through Trueview ads, as well as using beautiful light box ads across our display network. 
Now, a few words about our ad technologies for agencies and publishers. Again, video is at the forefront of our efforts here. 
Last month, we introduced a premium programmatic video marketplace called Google partner select to help publishers monetize their video content and to help agencies reach top quality video content across the web. The feedback that we've gotten from agencies and publishers has been great. We continue to see strong growth across premium inventory, particularly with the growth of private exchanges.  Across AdMob and AdSense, publishers are increasing their investments in mobile sites and apps and growing their businesses using our platforms. 
Before I move on to our emerging businesses, I want to talk about an area we've continued to invest in. Online tools for small businesses. Small businesses are the cornerstone of the world's economy and a major priority for us at Google. There's still a huge opportunity as over 50% of SMBs still don't have a website. To help set them up for online success, last month we introduced Google my business, which helps small businesses manage their online presence across Search, Maps, and Google+. 
We also have a vibrant ecosystem of partners who help local businesses optimize their AdWords campaigns, and we've been improving our customer support for small businesses. In fact, over the last three years, we've doubled our advertiser customer satisfaction scores which bodes really well. 
Now, let me talk about emerging new businesses, digital content, enterprise, and hardware. Google Play continues to grow at breakneck speed across all types of digital content, helping developers and content partners reach users around the world. For instance, Play movies is now available in over 90 countries with its recent additions in Argentina, Poland, and the Czech Republic. We also recently signed deals with CBS TV and Viacom to bring their TV content to Google Play. 
With over 1 billion active Android users, the growing success of Google Play means that more developers are building successful global businesses on our platform. As we mentioned at IO, since last June, we paid out more than $5 billion to developers through Play which clearly means it's a growing business for us as well. 
Shifting gears to our enterprise business, I can report that over 60% of the Fortune 500 use our paid products. This quarter, we added even more like Rockwell Collins.  They signed up 20,000 employees to use Google Apps. We also launched Google Drive for work, a premium service for businesses that includes unlimited storage. 
The reception so far has been great. And, we even closed our first sale within minutes of the announcement. 
Our cloud platform business also has momentum with new features announced at IO. 
On the hardware side, over 1 million Chrome books were sold into schools, clearly a record quarter. The popularity of Chromecast continues to grow. Now available in Australia, Korea, Portugal and many more. I got to watch some World Cup games from the ESPN app using my Chromecast. 
Before I close I want to mention our marketing team. In addition to a great IO this year, we also launched a made with code initiatives with partners like girl scouts of the USA and girls who code. To inspire the next generation of women coders. We are really excited by the enthusiasm around this initiative and who knows, hopefully some of these coders will join us as Google. 
With that, I'd like to thank today all the Googlers around the world. On a personal note, as you might have seen, I'm moving on to a new adventure. I 
'd like to thank Larry and Sergei and the founders at Google, my colleagues and Larry's staff as well as everyone at Google for the amazing experiences and the phenomenal 10 years I've had. I look forward to working with them in the future and cheering them from the sidelines. I'll hand back to Patrick. 

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [5]

          Thank you, Nikesh. As you've just heard, this will be Nikesh' last call. I want to take a minute on behalf of Nikesh, your friends here at Google, your colleagues and also all of our Googlers to thank you for all of your contributions to Google over what has been really a decade of work. A huge thanks. 
While many of you on the call may have questions about transition, if you don't mind, we'd like to keep the discussion focused on our performance in the last quarter if you don't mind. That's where we'll focus our questions. 
And, with that, why don't I turn it over to Jamie who will line us up for our Q&A. 


Questions and Answers
Operator    [1]

          (Operator Instructions) 
We'll take our first question from Mark Mahaney with RBC. 

Mark Mahaney,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [2]

          Thank you. Two quick questions.  The recovery in the growth rate in the UK, could you provide any more color around that?  Or, was it just that you had hard comps last quarter so that the growth rate is really consistent with what you had seen before? There has been some recent reporting about YouTube revenues. Could you just clarify, even if it's just historical data, the size of that asset and any more color around the growth there, new monetization initiatives, et cetera. Thank you. 

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [3]

          It's Patrick. And, as we -- Mark, as we had discussed in the last quarter, we had talked about the UK having had a tough comp the year before. You can see basically the recovery of that in the numbers, and we're pretty pleased with the momentum there. In terms of YouTube, I know there has been a lot of speculation out there, but in essence, what we have is great opportunities in front of us, and we don't comment on outside estimates. YouTube -- it serves as a powerful starting point for advertisers for looking to anchor their brand campaigns online and coupled with the online measurement of the digital audiences, be it Nielsen's, comScore, everything that we've just announced over the last couple quarters.  Clearly, a great runway ahead of it.  That's basically the story on YouTube. 

Mark Mahaney,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [4]

          Thank you, Patrick. 

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [5]

          Jamie, what's our next question, please. 

Operator    [6]

          We'll go next to Eric Sheridan with UBS. 

Eric Sheridan,  UBS - Analyst    [7]

          Thanks for taking the question. I guess for Nikesh, maybe we could get an update on your e-commerce initiatives? You called out retail as one of the strongest verticals in the quarter. Wanted to get a little more detail on what you might be seeing with PLAs?  And then, also the decision to extend Google Shopping Express to an overnight service in San Francisco? Thanks. 

Nikesh Arora,  Google Inc - SVP & Chief Business Officer    [8]

          Thanks, Eric, for your question. I think two quick answers to that. As we've talked in the past, PLAs is actually a fundamental, existential need of our product of our search business. As people did to tablets, as people go to mobile devices, they're looking for more and more precise answers from their search. The ability for them to go directly to the entity they're searching for is phenomenally powerful when you're searching for these things. [Steve Ernst's team] have done a great job with working with every retailer out there to try and get as many products listed in our product listing service so when you actually search you get a plethora of options in terms of where you can buy the product, what it's priced at, and how many products are available in that category.  
It's actually a very, very good evolution from a search perspective, which clearly translates into people clicking on those, and thereafter hopefully driving more commerce towards our partners in the retail segment. As I said, we drove three times as much traffic this quarter than we did same time last year. It's clearly good. 
In terms of Google Shopping Express, it started off as an experiment. Clearly, our users are delighted with the service. I can't seem to find people who are not happy with Google Shopping Express. And, we are seeing tremendous results. We're learning a lot. We're getting our logistics right.  We are getting our processes right. We believe it's clearly an opportunity for us, and our teams are really, really excited about continuing to invest in that area and keep experimenting with different formats and different solutions to make sure that we can provide the most optimized experience to our users. 

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [9]

          Just a point of clarification. You talked about an overnight service in San Francisco. In fact, we've launched overnight delivery in all of Northern California. But, that continues to be amazing, amazing demand for the product. 

Eric Sheridan,  UBS - Analyst    [10]

          Thanks. Good luck going forward, Nikesh. 

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [11]

          Thanks. 

Nikesh Arora,  Google Inc - SVP & Chief Business Officer    [12]

          Thank you very much. 

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [13]

          Jamie, let's go to our next question, please. 

Operator    [14]

          We'll go next to Ben Schachter with Macquarie. 

Ben Schachter,  Macquarie Research - Analyst    [15]

          Nikesh, good luck in your new role from me as well. Patrick, when you're budgeting for some of the longer term projects, and you're trying to think about the time frame to get to profitability -- for instance the team at Google X or Google 5 or something around self-driving cars, how do you think about the time frame for getting to profitability?  Is there any general rule on how far away it needs to be?   Related to that, in terms of the potential financial contribution within the next say three to five years, what are the new initiatives that you expect to have the most impact? Thanks. 

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [16]

          Thanks for your question, Ben. What you really have, as I have explained many times before, we set up our governance around a bit of like a VC model where we actually have gating and funding. Projects that have -- that are more software-based will have much shorter life times before we expect a bunch of returns. Projects that are much more fundamental physics R&D will have much longer time lines for actually funding and expected milestones. In both cases, they are all set around the boundaries of you have a business case, you have a thesis, and that thesis is basically tested on a regular basis through the gating of the funding that they get.  
And, in some cases, like self-driving cars, obviously multi-year, and we have a couple of other projects in X that are of that nature where it would take we think of half decades, sometimes even a bit longer before we know that you can get real momentum on revenue and profitability. Others are much shorter. That's how we think about it. What matters most is really that we actually set up that gating, and that we have these refinements to the business models. 
Google Shopping Express, another great example of that.  Where you have the gating, and then they come back for funding every so many months to look at where they're going. That's what we have. In terms of the next three to five years, I wouldn't be able to comment on the specifics of any one of those, but you can basically through the guidance I've just given you -- you can comb through what is really an asset-intensive versus a software-intensive play.  And then, it gives you a guidance of how fast and how slow we should expect our returns to be. 

Ben Schachter,  Macquarie Research - Analyst    [17]

          Thank you. 

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [18]

          Thanks, Ben.  Great question.  Jamie, let's go to our next question, please. 

Operator    [19]

          We'll go next to Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. 

Justin Post,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [20]

          A couple. You mentioned on the prepared remarks that the US growth is being impacted by some of the network changes. I don't suppose you could quantify it, but please do if you can. But, when do you think you work through all those changes, and we can start seeing a normalized growth rate?  Or, maybe you can answer by how far you're along that process? And then, the second question, pretty excited about Google Play opportunity. Can you just tell us, what's the margin opportunity related to Google Play?  Or, the profit opportunity? Thank you. 

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [21]

          I'll take the first, and then I'll let Nikesh talk about the second. On the first one, we have -- we've talked about this again, as you said so rightly, Justin. We have talked about a couple things going on, right. As early as early Q1 of 2013, we announced these DLA policy changes, and you'll all remember that.  And, we also reminded you at the time that by announcing these changes, it would take time to actually flow through to a bunch of partners across 2013. So, clearly there's an effect there on a year-over-year basis, as it didn't all happen in Q1 of 2013. 
In addition to that, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we continue to have ongoing user-focused product changes, and they continue to impact our AFS business as an example. So AFS, right, and then what you end up with is you all remember that AFS, our AdWords for Search -- AdSense for Search. It really skews to the US and the UK. Because of that, that's why you see the disproportion into those results. 
On the DLA, obviously, they will lapse over the course of this year, but the additional continued product changes and the user-focused product changes and policy changes, we will continue to hammer them to make sure that we get the perfect balance between what is right for the user and what is right for the advertiser. 
That's why all in all, I feel pretty confident in what I said when I said that we're pretty pleased with our growth rate in the US. As for the Play, why don't I actually let Nikesh give you a bit of comments on that. 

Nikesh Arora,  Google Inc - SVP & Chief Business Officer    [22]

          I think it's important to step back and look at what the Google Play team has achieved. It has come from nowhere. It's a phenomenal platform which provides services, apps, content around the world. As I mentioned, over 90 countries with Google Play movies. 
As Patrick would say, if you give away $5 billion to developers, which is $5,000 million.  It's a lot of money.  It's actually really great for innovation. It's phenomenal for the app developer ecosystem, and it's a really good binding glue for the Android ecosystem because people find tremendous amounts of agility in all the apps and all the services they get in Google Play. For us, we are really, really very excited about the Google Play opportunity. I think in terms of the margin, you should be able to look at the market and understand how typically these relationships work, and they should be no different than what the current market is around the margin opportunity for such services in the long-term. 

Justin Post,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [23]

          Great. Thank you. 

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [24]

          Thank you, Justin. Jamie, let's go to our next question, please. 

Operator    [25]

          We'll go next to Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank. 

Ross Sandler,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [26]

          Thanks.  I just had two questions. Product-related. So, at I/O, you announced some new innovation in search and discovery for apps including opening up app indexing globally. So, what kind of time line do you think Google is on before we start to see a lot of app content appearing in core search results more regularly?  And, what kind of revenue opportunity do you see around that? 
And then, the second question somewhat related is you also announced a bunch of new screens for Android watches, TVs, et cetera. I know it's still very early days, but do you envision the long-term business model for these being similar to the existing model with ads in Google Play?  Or, do you see potentially doing closed-loop transactions, as an example? Thanks. 

Nikesh Arora,  Google Inc - SVP & Chief Business Officer    [27]

          Ross, thank you for your question. Let's talk about the app indexing first and then about the screen stuff. If you think about it, Google has been in the business of making sure that we drive traffic on behalf of people and advertisers and help people find things, and as we look at mobile phone behavior, people spend a lot of time on apps as well as in the browser searching for things. I think it's important for us to make sure that we provide the content that users are looking for. You should expect us to most aggressively try and make sure that app indexing happens and it's available and easily accessible across devices. 
If people are looking for things, we provide them the most relevant answer in which in certain cases, that happen to be the app. Allowing for people to discover apps as well as creating more engagement for apps that people may not have been open to engaging with for a while. Clearly, an area of focus, and clearly, you should see -- expect us to see activity in that space. In terms of revenue, it's not unlike any revenue we create in search where we help people find things and that allows us to create an advertising opportunity where we are able to monetize that on behalf of our properties. 
In terms of your second question, I think you have to take a longer term point of view towards the screen question. As you can see, the old screens were almost designed as island where every screen has its own operating system, has its own ability to work. We are noticing more and more people want to switch from screens and retain the service experience, and towards that end, the Android 2 is doing a phenomenal job making sure we provide that seamlessness across screens and that fungibility of services across those screens. I think in the long term, we have to think about this as a user-centric model. We are helping users take their services fungibly from one screen to the other and making that happen seamlessly, and if that works out, I think there will be phenomenal business opportunities for us in the future. At Google, we always worry about the user first, and we'll figure out the monetization when we have a lot of users excited about it. 

Ross Sandler,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [28]

          Thank you. 

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [29]

          Jamie, why don't we go to our next question. 

Operator    [30]

          We'll go next to Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein. 

Carlos Kirjner,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. - Analyst    [31]

          Two questions if I may. One on revenue, is there a significant positive net impact of growing penetration in usage of smartphones on search Plays and revenue?  And, what happens to search revenue growth if there is no more benefit in developed markets as smartphone penetration approaches 100%? Second, you added more than 2,400 employees to Google in the quarter versus 1,400 in the second quarter last year. I think that's the highest quarterly headcount addition in more than two years. Patrick, is this the new norm?   In terms of the rate in which you grow headcount for the core, how do you think about the rate of headcount growth versus gross profit?  Or, you don't think about that at all? Thank you. 

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [32]

          Let me tackle the second one. Then, I'll let Nikesh talk about the first one. On the issue of headcount -- look, we have this amazing opportunity and machine to actually look around the world to look for the best engineers, and we promised ourselves that given the bar is very, very high, when we do find people that fit the culture and that we think will actually do a great contribution and be great Googlers, we actually don't hesitate and we hire them. Because if we hire them a bit too early or a bit too late -- on balance, we're very happy to have them early on. You are right that if you look at the last couple quarters, the trend has been pretty solid. In addition to that, you have to look at the impact also of our acquisitions.  When we make acquisitions, that compounds a bit the numbers. 
From that perspective, Carlos, we don't set up a specific target. We say we're going to end up with X amount for this quarter, and then once we hit our quota, we see everybody else next quarter. From that perspective, we're a bit more organic about it. We are -- the vast majority of our hiring -- to give comfort to our investors it is really still in the engineering field and the product management field, which is really where we want to focus our attention.  And, we continue to focus there. So, that's basically the puzzle with which we work. On the question, maybe Nikesh can talk about revenue and smartphone penetration. 

Nikesh Arora,  Google Inc - SVP & Chief Business Officer    [33]

          Of course. Unequivocally, the answer is yes. As we see more and more user penetration of smartphones, people spend more time looking for things on smartphones. I think there's a very, very long sort of runway that this opportunity has because we're just seeing people getting onto smartphones. Now, you're beginning to see businesses and other websites take mobile very, very seriously. They want to be present on mobile.  I think the revenue opportunity is phenomenally high because right now mobile does not monetize as well as certain other forms but given the huge influx of queries we're seeing, we expect as people make it more and more relevant to be able to find information in the long-term probably should be monetizing even better than desktops. I think it's a tremendous runway going forward.  I don't think we have to fear the saturation of smartphone penetration in developed markets for a while. 

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [34]

          We'll take our next question, Jamie. 

Operator    [35]

          We'll go next to Anthony DiClemente with Nomura. 

Anthony DiClemente,  Nomura - Analyst    [36]

          Thanks very much. Patrick, can you give us an update on your Internet access initiatives, particularly Google Fiber?  Maybe update us on the evolution of the economics of that business, and then perhaps even the timing of the Google Fiber roll-out for more recently announced cities. A separate question on the Google Compute Engine business. How big of a growth driver can GCE be?  And, what do you see as the competitive advantage that Google has in what seems to be an increasingly competitive space in terms of the cloud? Thanks. 

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [37]

          Why don't I jump on the first one, and Nikesh, if you don't mind talking about GCE afterwards. Here's what's going on with Google Fiber. It's important to bear in mind the following. First is, the economics of a fiber network today are clearly much cheaper than they were, say, a decade ago. There has been a lot of improvements and cost reductions in technology components all through the fiber network, but also in the way we build it. A second one is -- I just want to remind everyone -- that an important part of our strategy is actually to build the demand. Unlike the typical overbuilder, actually we have a very different kind of business model and thesis for that.  We do work closely with each city to streamline the process that keeps, again, the cost of construction way down. 
So, as an update to you -- right now, Anthony, we have as you know, we are working with 34 cities, separate cities, with a completed checklist of items to help us prepare for the next wave of our construction project.  We're going to be basically -- they're in the last [throes] of finishing these checklists and coming back with us. Over the coming months, we'll actually be going through all of the details with them whether they be right of way or permitting or otherwise.  And, that's what we're going to use to make decisions as to how broad a program we'll have. We expect that to give an update between now and the end of the year as the information comes along. We're really thrilled about the opportunity. It continues to be a great piece of focus for us, and just stay tuned for more -- the next update on it. As per the GCE, do you want to take it, Nikesh? 

Nikesh Arora,  Google Inc - SVP & Chief Business Officer    [38]

          Yes. I think what's very important on Sense, and we've talked about this in the past.  That we believe there is a lot of businesses out there have still to shift to the cloud. We think in the long-term every business will be most efficient when they shift to the cloud. We're not really concerned about trying to compete with other cloud providers. What we're really concerned about is making sure we have an amazing offering for businesses so they find value in working with us and making sure that we can support them in their transition to the cloud. 
We think we have a great set of products. Our team is really excited. We're beginning to ramp up. I think there is tremendous opportunity going forward. I think it won't be time to slice the pie for a long time because a lot of businesses are clamoring to move their business to the cloud because that's where the users already are because we're used to the cloud and are personalizing it. And it's about time that our business that's we work in actually got to the leading edge of technology as much as the consumer services are. 

Anthony DiClemente,  Nomura - Analyst    [39]

          Thank you very much. 

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [40]

          Thanks, Anthony. Jamie, let's go to our next call, please. 

Operator    [41]

          We'll go next to Mark May with Citigroup. 

Mark May,  Citigroup - Analyst    [42]

          Thanks for taking my questions. A follow-up on the network business. I think some of the quality initiatives that you've been undergoing and continue to for a while, part of the intended consequence or result I would imagine would be to recognize higher overall CPCs or pricing over time. But, that doesn't seem to have been the case so far. So, wonder if you could shed a little light as to why we're not seeing that show up in some of the metrics?  What your expectations are going forward? Is that, in fact, one of the intended consequences that we should be expecting going forward? 
And then, secondly, you've highlighted not just this quarter but previously that one of the main headwinds to the Company's overall CPCs has been the mix shift around geography. I wonder if you could shed some light on if you've been seeing or making any progress in closing the gap there?  Maybe in markets like APAC?  And, what exactly are you doing to try to improve pricing outside of the domestic and more established markets? 

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [43]

          So, Mark, it's Patrick. I think that you rightly point to the fact that we are spending -- there's so many factors. The issue we have with the CPC -- one of the key things about CPC is clearly it gives you a trend. But, the trend is really shaped by the combination of CPC and click. So, you can't just look at one in isolation of the other. It's really that mix of the two.  And, in the case of network, for example, we just discussed at the beginning of the call that we've put a lot of time and a lot of energy in the last 18 months to actually work on quality issues.  And, that clearly has an impact when you push on quality to -- when you look at the mix to actually drive for the kind of revenues and growth rates that you see in our results on network. 
Having said that, it's also compensated by all of the other positive factors that we see, whether it be, as you said, geography or product mix or otherwise. So, all in all, I think that the team is doing a good job both on network and on sites, and you can see that as well on our detailed information about sites where we continue to see certainly over the last few quarters kind of creeping back up of CPCs which actually continue to push for this quality issue. 
In terms of geography, I think that yes, geography makes a big difference in that CPCs are much -- in some cases lower in international markets or emerging markets, but the team continues with a number of localization initiatives to --. We don't take CPCs as just one general. We will focus on each country, look for initiatives on localizations for each country to get the maximum CPCs on a geographic basis -- country by country basis.  That's why you'll see a lot of our localization initiatives. They're just one again, one contributor. And, it's really early days. There's so much more potential in many of these areas, and that's why Shridhar team and our search teams continue to work side-by-side to continue to push on these areas. 
So, we see a lot of runway in this one, and geography is just one of these areas.  And, you mentioned APAC, but APAC is a combination of more mature markets like Australia and Japan, and then we have the real emerging markets in there as well like Indonesia or India. And so, even APAC itself is, again, localization matters immensely because very different answer for different countries. But, all in all, a pretty good story, and we're really proud to continue to focus with this balance between user-first and then make sure that we have the right monetization. Thanks for your question, Mark. Jamie, let's go to our next question, please. 

Operator    [44]

          We'll go next to Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. 

Douglas Anmuth,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [45]

          Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask two things. First, thanks for the added disclosure, just on volume and CPCs. If we look at the sites data on pricing, it looks like we've seen an inflection here over the last two quarters, and then now more flattish here sequentially in 2Q. Can we interpret from that we've seen the worst in terms of the negative pricing impact from mobile? Can you give us some color on what you're seeing in terms of like for like mobile pricing at this point? 
And then, secondly, just on CapEx, Patrick.  Can you just help us understand how your philosophy maybe has changed around CapEx spending over the last few years, and if you're in this period of building out potentially a lot of excess capacity, is it reasonable to think here at some point over the next few quarters we could also see things slow down as the business grows into that spending more? Thanks. 

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [46]

          Douglas, let me start with the last question first, and then I'll jump to the first. On CapEx, listen -- if you listen to the script I gave a couple minutes ago, interestingly this quarter in priority order was construction of data centers, second was actually real estate, which typically would have been historically you would have heard me talk about kind of equipment, and then equipment was third. So, CapEx continues -- we think continues to be a strategic asset of ours, and you're correct in that we've signaled that.  That we're actually building -- we have a big building program right now because these are long lead time items for our data centers.  And, we just talked about a minute ago about GCE and other cloud services that continue to grow. So, to strategically have the capacity versus not having the capacity is such a strategic asset to us that we'll continue to look that way. 
In terms of real estate, we found the same thing. We found that we have -- when we have opportunities to actually acquire real estate that it's a make versus -- so buy versus lease option.  And, if you think of our growth and the growth in the strategic areas where we want to be, when we find great opportunities, I think that we have a no-regret move in actually taking that action. You're seeing more activities on that front which answers a bit a lot of questions have been around is the core business capital intensity growing. You can see from these data points that it's not really that. It's really a strategic focus that we have right now in making sure that we have the long-term assets necessary to win. So, that's basically the mindset in which we're kind of investing in CapEx. 
In the volume of CPCs, you're talking about more flattish sequential in Q2. This is for sites, I assume, was that for sites? 

Douglas Anmuth,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [47]

          For sites and the lower or smaller decline over the last two quarters. 

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [48]

          Again, I would refer you back to the IR team to get a lot of more detailed questions, but I think on a quarterly basis, there can be so many fluctuations. I think year-over-year gives you a much more realistic trend about what is fundamentally going on in the business because one or two changes can really swing -- even seasonality can swing quite a bit both in terms of growth rates or CPCs, clicks and CPCs. Beware always of -- if you can see that in the network numbers, clearly on the quarter-over-quarter as well, there's a lot of noise in the data. You have to be careful in the quarter by quarter. But, year-over-year actually gives you a pretty good story of the efforts we're putting into this. That's how I would do it. Thank you very much for your questions. Jamie, let's go to our next question, please. 

Operator    [49]

          We'll go next to Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities. 

Peter Stabler,  Wells Fargo Securities - Analyst    [50]

          Thanks for taking the questions.  Just wanted to revisit the topic of small business for a second. Could you help us understand a little bit on some of the qualities of the small business growth profile? Is this about bringing businesses that have no online identity online?  Or, is it about taking more mature small businesses and getting a greater share of the spending?  Just wondering if you could step back and maybe give yourself a report card on the small business progress you've made and where the best opportunities are. Thanks very much. 

Nikesh Arora,  Google Inc - SVP & Chief Business Officer    [51]

          Thanks, Peter, for the question. I think, again, if you think about the phenomenal scale at which the Google team operates vis-a-vis small businesses is staggering. We have millions of advertisers, millions of publishers we deal with. And, we try and make sure that millions of publishers get monetization through advertising. At the same time, we try and make sure that millions of small businesses achieve their goals in trying to drive traffic, both online and offline into whatever service they're offering to their end users. 
As we've gone through this transition to mobile, it's very important that these small businesses make that transition effectively because all the user traffic is slowly and steadily shifting towards mobile.  Part of our effort is to make sure that we work closely with all of our small business advertisers existing to help them go mobile, at the same time trying to bring on more small businesses both onto the mobile and the desktop platform. It's really a concerted effort to try and support small businesses around the world.  It's a very targeted programs to show them ROI, to show them the value of living online because we believe in the long-term that's where most business is going to get conducted. It's really a long-term strategic effort to bring them all on board, and I think the teams are doing a phenomenal job executing that around the world. 

Peter Stabler,  Wells Fargo Securities - Analyst    [52]

          Thanks for the color, Nikesh. 

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [53]

          Thank you, Peter. Jamie, let's go to our next question, please. 

Operator    [54]

          We'll go next to Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. 

Heather Bellini,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [55]

          Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. I had two. I guess given the success of Chromebooks over the past two years, how do you think about the direction of Android and Chrome from a development standpoint as you look out and also when you think about the multi-screen comments that you made before, that the value being able to transfer people's experiences across screens. 

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [56]

          Did you say you had two questions, Heather. 

Heather Bellini,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [57]

          And then, I had a second one was just -- I was going to start with that one since it was long-winded. The second one was just Google Shopping Express seems to be a great way to impact the small business environment. I'm just wondering now that we're seeing that expand into different areas, is that kind of the -- should we start to see an inflection in small business advertising adoption? 

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [58]

          Let me -- okay, so we got the two questions. I think Google Shopping Express is really about local, and local is really about both small businesses as well as large business. It really -- so absolutely small businesses will be as part of the focus area. And, we're engaging with many of them, which is actually pretty terrific. But, it's really about local. So, it's not only with a focus of small businesses. And, that's really the focus of Shopping Express. 
In the case of Chromebooks and Android, we've discussed this many times in the past where basically you have a great convergence because there's humongous strength in both of these platforms. They're basically converging in many ways.  Today, you can for example, on an Android phone, Chrome powers the search and vice versa. So, we have a lot of these cross-pollination between the two teams.   They are under one leadership which is Sundar. He basically actually makes sure that these two teams continue to work into an integrated fashion. 
Everybody knows that Chrome has a huge focus on security. That is, in fact, a great focus to migrate over into the Android ecosystem to make sure that we have the equivalent of enterprise-grade security for all of our users whether they be Chrome or Android. So, I think that when you think of multi-screen, there are both of these OSs are actually very complementary to each other, and that's why we continue to work in parallel. I think that across these multi-screens, you should expect -- Android continues to be very much the thing of choice for mass and Chrome continues to be very much the enterprise infrastructure.  You should continue to see kind of that evolve with that collaboration. 
That's how we think about it, Heather. It's not a -- there's no -- it's one or the other. I think they are perfect complements. So, thank you for your question. Jamie, we'll go to our next question, please. 

Operator    [59]

          We'll take our next question from Youssef Squali with Cantor Fitzgerald. 

Youssef Squali,  Cantor Fitzgerald - Analyst    [60]

          Thank you very much. Two quick questions, please. Going back to Doug's question about CapEx, can you -- Patrick, can you give us any example of a non-search initiative where you've invested heavily over the last maybe three, four, five years where the ROI today exceeds your threshold. I'm assuming maybe on the display side. 
And then, on the YouTube content strategy, how high in the professionally created content funnel do you want to get over time? We've seen more and more professionally created content. If you could help us with that, that would be great. Thank you. 

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [61]

          We have a whole host of products where, just think of this Play, think of YouTube, think of Maps. There has been so many of these products that have -- yes, Gmail, Chrome, Android, all of those.  Whether they are directly tied to advertising because they're an advertising product, or they're a platform that actually gives you distribution that gives you a great infrastructure on which that fuels the searches and the advertising.  I think that we have so many areas that we get absolutely terrific returns. It's not only about search. It's really about the entire experience and the delivery around them. Then, your second question is -- could you just repeat the second question for me, please? 

Youssef Squali,  Cantor Fitzgerald - Analyst    [62]

          Sure. Just trying to understand the strategy -- the content strategy within YouTube. Just how high do you want to go up the professionally created content funnel?  And, how do you plan on monetizing -- how do you plan monetization if it's a -- is it all advertising?  Or, is there another model? 

Nikesh Arora,  Google Inc - SVP & Chief Business Officer    [63]

          Thank you, Youssef, for the question. I think it's fair to say that YouTube has all forms of professional content available today. It has all the way from user content to very popular user content with people like Michelle Fan, et cetera, and it has a lot of clips from professionally created content from various media partners.  We talked about CBS and Viacom in the earnings call. We have lots and lots of content from different players out there, and our monetization model on YouTube is working. It's a phenomenal model. 
It is now the lynchpin for each of our brand strategies where partners and advertisers want to come work with us to create brand campaigns because YouTube allows you to actually target a fragmented set of interests in a most efficient fashion as opposed to try and do burst advertising that you would do on television and broadcast. So, clearly the monetization model is working. 
In terms of other models as you've seen in the past we have experimented with various models on YouTube, and we continue to experiment to see if advertising is the only model or there are ways that we can monetize using subscription or paid-for content. I think we will continue to do and see which ones stick with the users. 

Youssef Squali,  Cantor Fitzgerald - Analyst    [64]

          Thanks. All the best, Nikesh. 

Nikesh Arora,  Google Inc - SVP & Chief Business Officer    [65]

          Thank you very much. Appreciate it. 

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [66]

          Why don't we go to our next question, please, Jamie. 

Operator    [67]

          We'll go next to Richard Kramer with Arete Research. 

Richard Kramer,  Arete Research - Analyst    [68]

          Thanks very much. Nikesh, could you just expand on that last comment?  Putting together Google Fiber and a year on from YouTube channels, how important is it for Google over time to establish a subscription-based type revenue stream, especially if content moves to bundles?  
For Patrick, two things that would help us benchmark Google versus peers. First of all, can you talk about the portion of ad growth, or even the overall ad sales which are being driven by mobile?  And also, clearly there's some questioning of the notion that large amounts of offshore cash can be permanently reinvested Can you tell us what portion of cash is now offshore, and how we should think about international opportunities that might absorb these very large volumes of cash?  

Nikesh Arora,  Google Inc - SVP & Chief Business Officer    [69]

          Thank you very much for the question. I think in terms of your question around Google Fiber, YouTube, content bundling, subscription revenue streams. I think it's a very good question. I think it's an area where there's a lot of movement across the board.  Where different people are trying different models, where cable is trying to provide content over the top, or YouTube is available on television screens.  Where people are trying to increase the broadband speeds because everybody gets a sense that we will consume more and more broadband content. 
I think what is clear to us in this process is that bandwidth will continue to increase. People's appetite for bandwidth will continue to go up. It's clear that people will consume content more and more in a nonlinear fashion. It's clear that content will come from different places, not just the traditional mechanisms of cable and television. I think that's pretty clear.  It's also clear that people will monetize content both either in some form of payment or some form of advertising. Beyond that, how all of this coagulates and takes form still remains to be seen. 
I think it's fair to say we are experimenting on different ends of the spectrum where we have, like YouTube purely is advertising-based content and monetized today which is over the top.    Which works on broadband.  We have Google Fiber. We have channel bundles. We are experimenting. We are playing in every space. I think eventually the user will decide, whatever is most convenient and they are most able to use -- they will decide. But, I think it's fair to say we have a horse in every one of these races. 

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [70]

          That's terrific. Let me jump into the second question. I'm going to -- once again take a bit of exception, to the premise of your argument about how much is driven by mobile. We really are living in a multi-screen world. You start on mobile.  You hop on tablet.  You go to your desktop. You come back to your television.  You Chromecast back to your TV. That's the world in which we live. 
When people say, how much of your advertising is really driven by one. We do a lot of research that actually shows, that in fact, that's what we try to show to our advertisers is how much attribution to show to each of these elements within the chain of activities that actually leads to the end which is either a consumption of something or a purchase. From that perspective, that's why we don't actually talk about mobile as a percentage of ads. What really matters is that you have the footprint across all of these devices and modes to actually deliver the best answer to our users. That's why you heard about IO continuing to expand that landscape. 
In the case of CapEx in international, like last quarter our offshore cash was about 60%, and 40% in the US. We'll share those numbers in our 10-Q, so stay tuned. In rough numbers, that's really where we stand today. It may move a percentage here and there. We do have great opportunities outside the US as well to actually invest our cash. Whether it be through acquisitions, you've seen a number of acquisitions in the last year that were made internationally as well as we're building data centers outside of the US. Our headquarters in Ireland continues to grow, and we're investing quite a bit of money there as well and to the real estate.  So, when you see our real estate numbers, they may include over time a number of these projects in Ireland. But, also in London and other places where we're investing.  
So, we actually have pretty exciting plans for our international portfolio, both in APAC and in Europe. And so, there's a real great case to actually continue to keep this amount offshore. It's not a shortage of opportunities that we have. It's just a question of pace and discipline. 
Thank you for that. Thank you, Richard. Maybe we have time for one more. We'll take one more question. 

Operator    [71]

          We'll take our final question from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird. 

Colin Sebastian,  Robert W. Baird & Co. - Analyst    [72]

          Great. Thanks for taking my questions. First off, Nikesh, congratulations and good luck. 
Firstly, through Google Play and applications such as Shopping Express, there already is a transactional model in place in terms of purchases and payments. I guess I wonder if it wouldn't be natural to assume that some of that transactional functionality could be extended to Google Shopping and PLA more broadly.  Or, is it really just about driving traffic to third-party sites for those businesses? And then, secondly, just a clarification on the cost-per-click breakout from the report. Why aggregated cost-per-click year-over-year growth is actually better than individually the Google sites and the network sites? Thank you. 

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [73]

          I can actually give you the answer to the last one, and then you can come back. It's basically the Simpson's -- what is it called, paradigm -- paradox. If you go on Wikpedia, and you check the Simpson's paradox, you'll understand that you may have two factors that are actually correlated in the same directions, but when you actually put them together, they actually may correlate in inverse proportion. That's what you get into the numbers. That's why you have this kind of discrepancy, because we all laughed at this number as well because when we saw it we said -- hey, something doesn't add up. In fact, it does add up.  That's really the issue there, Colin. And, unless you already know the Simpson's paradox, then don't go to Wikpedia. 

Colin Sebastian,  Robert W. Baird & Co. - Analyst    [74]

          I'll search Google first. 

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [75]

          On the first question -- go ahead, Nikesh. 

Nikesh Arora,  Google Inc - SVP & Chief Business Officer    [76]

          On the first question, I think that's a fair observation, Colin. I think if you look at some of the applications that our payments team has developed around instabuy, it's the ability to do a one-click buy where we can partner with merchants and any kinds of transaction providers where they don't have to keep entering their data or entering their credit card in different places.  So, it gives them the comfort and ease of transaction. 
I think over time it's like an open system solution where we have platforms where retailers can work with us and pick and choose what part of our platform they want to leverage, and our hope is to create a more and more frictionless ability to create transactions, which effectively benefits commerce, and hopefully creates more revenue opportunities for us. 

Colin Sebastian,  Robert W. Baird & Co. - Analyst    [77]

          Okay. Great, thank you. 

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [78]

          Thanks, Colin. I usually stop by thanking all the Googlers, but Nikesh. 

Nikesh Arora,  Google Inc - SVP & Chief Business Officer    [79]

          I just wanted to take a moment and thank everybody on the call for tolerating and enduring me on this call and supporting me over the last many years.  Thank you, everyone. I look forward to working with you in the future in a different role. 

Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [80]

          And, with that, we're going to actually thank all the Googlers for their amazing work over the last 90 days. It has been a real roller coaster, continuing with I/O and everything else, and we look forward to Q3. Nikesh, all the best. Jamie, I'll let you close the call. 

Operator    [81]

          Thank you. Again, that does conclude today's conference. We do appreciate everyone's participation. Have a great day.
