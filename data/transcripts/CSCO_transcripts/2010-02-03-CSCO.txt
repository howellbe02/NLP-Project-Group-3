Operator    [1]

           Welcome to Cisco Systems second-quarter and fiscal year 2010 financial results conference call.  At the request of Cisco Systems, today's conference is being recorded.  If you have any objections, you may disconnect.  Now I would like to introduce Ms.  Blair Christie, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications for Cisco Systems.  Ma'am, you may begin. 

Blair Christie,  Cisco Systems - SVP, Corporate Communications    [2]

           Great.  Thank you, Bridget.  Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our 80th quarterly conference call.  I am joined by John Chambers, our Chairman and CEO; Frank Calderoni, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Rob Lloyd, Executive Vice President of Worldwide Operations; Ned Hooper, Chief Strategy Officer and Senior Vice President of Consumer Business, and Padmasree Warrior, Chief Technology Officer, as well as Laura Graves, our Director of Global Investor Relations.
 The Q2 fiscal year 2010 press release is on US High Tech Market Wire and on the Cisco website at www.board/newsroom.Cisco.com.  I would like to remind you that we have a corresponding webcast with slides.  In those slides you will find the financial information we cover during this conference call, as well as additional financial metrics and analysis that you might find helpful.  Additionally downloadable Q2 financial statements will be available following the call, including revenue by product and geography.  Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements can also be found on our website in the Investor Relations section.  Click on the financials of the section of the website to access the slides and these documents.
 A replay of this call will be available via telephone from February 3 through February 10 at 866-357-4205 or 203-369-0122 for international callers and is also available from February 3 through April 23 on Cisco's Investor Relations website.
 Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results.  The financial results in the press release are un-audited.  The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements and as such are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discussed in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly report on Form 10-Q and any applicable amendments, which identify important risk factors which that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.  Unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted, and now I would like to turn it over to John for his commentary on the quarter.
 John? 

John Chambers,  Cisco Systems - Chairman & CEO    [3]

           Thank you, Blair, and welcome back, by the way.  During the opening comments of the conference call, I will focus on what I view to be the key takeaways for Q2 fiscal year 2010.
 First, from a very candid discussion about what we are seeing in the market on a global basis relative to Q2 and its effects on our Q3 fiscal 2010 expectations.  Second, an update on our rapidly improving financial measurements and some interesting geographic and sequentially quarter metrics.  Third, a high-level summary of some of our investments and results in new market adjacencies in Q2.  And then finally, our revenue guidance for Q3 fiscal year 2010 with the appropriate caveats.
 Following these opening comments, Frank will provide additional details on Q2.  In the third section, we will focus on business momentum from a strategy, customer segment, geographic and product basis.  Frank will then follow with additional financial parameters around our guidance.  I will then wrap it up with some comments in terms of Cisco's momentum going into Q3 fiscal year 2010, and finally, our Q&A session.
 From a summary point of view, I think there were a number of key takeaways from the results in Q2 fiscal year 2010, and I will attempt to cover these at this time.  First, from a financial perspective, the second quarter was very strong, well exceeding even our own optimistic expectations.  The financial results were in my opinion outstanding.  Revenues of $9.8 billion increasing 8% year over year were dramatically above the high end of our expectations of an increase of 1% to 4%.
 Q2 revenue showed a 9% sequential increase over Q1 revenues, the highest fiscal Q1 to Q2 sequential increase I have seen in the last decade.  Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.40, a 25% year over year increase, was again well above our expectations.
 Expense management was very solid with non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenue at 35.3% versus Q1's 37%.  Non-GAAP product gross margins were very solid at 65.6%.  Cash generated from operations in Q2 was approximately $2.5 billion, and we repurchased 1.5 billion of stock during the quarter under our repurchase program.  Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of revenue was a very strong 30.3% versus Q2's 29.3%.  Non-GAAP net income of $2.3 billion was up 25% year-over-year.  To put these sequential dramatic improvements of non-GAAP net income as an example in Q2 into comparable terms, Q1's net income was a decrease year over year of minus 15%.
 Product book-to-bill was approximately 1.  Services continued its strong growth with year-over-ear revenue of approximately 6%.  In an area that we have not discussed since the start of the downturn for obvious reasons, productivity has increased dramatically during the last two quarters.  The data behind this is going back to last Q1.  Revenue per employee increased to $558,000, which was up 8% over Q4 of fiscal year '09.  Q2 revenue per employee was $606,000, which was approximately a 9% increase over the prior quarter.  Parts of the increase was due to just raw revenue growth, but we believe an equal amount was due to our new organization structures and use of our own collaborative products.  We were very pleased with this when you consider that out of the 30 plus market adjacencies we are moving into, many of them do not have any material or measurable material revenue contribution at this time, even though we have allocated a large amount of headcount to these new market adjacencies.  In other words, we believe our real productivity was well above the hard numbers.
 The market over the last year has evolved pretty much as we expected and indicated in our conference calls.  Q3 last fiscal year was the bottom.  Q4, in our opinion, FY '09, as we said at the time, was a tipping point, the beginning of the upturn from a capital spending perspective.  Q1 fiscal year 2010 saw an acceleration in the first phase of the recovery, and in our opinion Q2 marked the second phase of the recovery with additional across-the-board acceleration -- in other words, balance across the board -- in all of our geographies and market segments.  We saw very strong balance growth from a year-over-year perspective in almost all of these major geographies and market segment categories.
 To give you additional detail on our geographic and marked acceleration moving from Q1's first phase to Q2's second phase of the recovery and Q1 from a theater perspective, only one theater -- interestingly enough, Japan -- had meaningful product order growth.  While in Q2 all five of the theaters saw flat to double-digit product order growth.
 In Q1, again from an orders perspective, only two of our top 15 countries around the world saw year-over-year positive growth.  In Q2 eight of 15 countries saw year-over-year positive growth.
 From a Q2 market segment perspective, enterprise, service provider and commercial also ordered growth in the mid-single digits to low double-digit range.  While in the prior quarter, Q1, all of these market segments were negative from a year-over-year perspective.
 While most markets around the world are continuing to improve, we were especially pleased with our product order growth in the US, up approximately 17% year-over-year.
 Asia Pacific and Japan both grew in double-digits year-over-year.  Europe was up in low single digits, and emerging markets were flat.  In our opinion, based upon our business momentum and prior economic recoveries, this would indicate that the recovery from a capital spending perspective is very strong and moving into the second phase of a reasonably balanced across-the-board growth.
 In our opinion Q2 FY10 results were remarkably well-balanced from a product, geographic and market segment perspective, which should indicate a solid economic recovery.  While the continued strength of the recovery and the eventual job creation may still be in question, we clearly are basing our decisions and investments upon an optimistic evolution of the economy.  If we get surprised, we will adjust, and we have a proven track record of being able to do so when appropriate.
 Given our views of the economy expressed over the last four quarters, with the expanding role of intelligent networks in all forms of communications and IT, combined with our ability to catch market transitions and move into new market adjacencies, we are proud of our ability to return to our prior financial operating model so quickly after the global economic slowdown.  Our new organization structure of councils, boards and working groups as discussed in the last few calls is operating very effectively and has been an important part of managing through the recent downturn and then positioning us for the acceleration of results achieved during the last two quarters.  These structures allow speed, scale, flexibility and rapid replication.  We will continue to move into additional market adjacencies which are currently at about 30.  And of perhaps equal importance, many of our leading customers now are beginning to understand how this highly innovative management structure combined with new business models can launch this many product families and movement into new market adjacencies while still maintaining revenue growth and market share gains in our traditional areas.
 We exit Q2 with a compelling financial position and an innovation engine from both a product and a business model perspective that should position us to expand our leadership in the marketplace.
 Our internal startups, partnerships and our acquisitions continue to fill out our architectural strategy.  And innovations in our traditional routing and switching product families have a very high probability of gaining market share.
 I also believe that more of our customers are beginning to understand that the market adjacencies are interrelated and as such will at first loosely then tightly be coupled together from both a technology and a business architecture perspective, enabled by the common theme of the network as the platform for all forms of communications and IT.  If the market adjacencies play out the way we expect, it will be very similar to what we saw with the original Advanced Technologies being viewed as standalone and then over time becoming loosely and now starting to be tightly integrated.  For those areas that Cisco can control or influence, we feel that we're doing very well.  The key market transitions relative to collaboration, virtualization and video networking, which will drive productivity and growth in network loads for the next decade, are continuing to evolve even faster than we thought just several quarters ago.  While we attempt to be very transparent with what we are seeing in the market and have established a good track record in terms of seeing trends early, our views do not tend to change every month or quarter.  And even when they do evolve, to change dramatically is really an exception.  It is with this consistency of staying focused on the long-term, while not getting distracted by short-term market activities, that drives our strategy and, in our opinion, our future success.
 While we believe the recovery is now occurring, no one knows for sure how strong it will be, how long it will last or the extent of new job creation.  But, as we said in prior quarters' conference calls, we are going to continue to be very aggressive to position ourselves for an optimistic view of global economic growth while continuing to maintain tight financial management in aligning our resources to new opportunities.  I believe Q2 was a very positive proof point that both our vision and our strategy for our industry is evolving as expected and, at the same time, our ability to execute the vision and strategy as demonstrated by very strong Q2 results.
 Given our belief that the market is beginning to accelerate and our productivity growth in terms of revenue per headcount of a 17% increase in just two quarters, it is probably not a surprise to anyone that you will now see us start to grow our expenses at a faster pace as we continue to expand in our traditional business areas and move into these 30 plus market adjacencies.  We would expect with all the appropriate caveats about the continued economic recovery to add between 2000 to 3000 people to Cisco in the next several quarters.  We will continue to be very aggressive in both our own internal innovation commitments, as well as our partnership and acquisition strategies.  For those Cisco employees listening, this growth in headcount will continue to be very targeted towards strategic opportunities with focus on productivity improvements in many of our traditional functions while adding resources to drive new market adjacencies.
 Also, as we said in conference calls over many years, Cisco will always be affected by major economic changes, capital spending patterns, new and existing competitors, potential issues affecting our suppliers and our ability to execute or not on our strategy and other factors as discussed in our SEC filings.  For purposes of our long-range goals, as well as our quarterly guidance, we are also assuming that our vision of how the industry and the market will evolve will be accurate, and we will effectively execute on that vision.
 With all this in mind, we will continue to provide our guidance with all the appropriate caveats one quarter at a time and encourage each of our shareholders to not get too far ahead of themselves on building the positives of this quarter.
 Given all the uncertainties regarding the strength and shape of the recovery, concerns about recovery possibly slowing, an unknown extent of job creation, we encourage you to wait for additional quarterly data before becoming too optimistic.  This is what you would expect from Cisco and what I would encourage from our shareholders.
 Before providing guidance for Q3, I would like to remind you that Q3 includes an extra week which occurs once every five to six years.  As we have indicated in prior years, this extra week does not translate into a mathematical additional 113 in terms of your modeling for Q3 orders.  Although, as Frank reminds me regularly, it does in terms of expenses.
 Our best estimate of the benefit for an extra week from an order perspective is an incremental one-time 2% to 3% of total product orders.  With this discussion in mind, our revenue guidance for Q3 fiscal year 2010, including our usual caveats as discussed earlier and in our financial reports, is for revenue to increase in the 23% to 26% range year over year.
 As we shared with you during the economic transitions, we continue to track sequential improvement quarter to quarter.  As the transition, however, continues, you will see us move back to focus primarily on year-over-year comparisons.  In summary, we believe that we are very well positioned in terms of the industry from a vision, differentiated strategy and execution perspective.  We believe we are entering the next phase of the Internet as growth in productivity will center on collaboration enabled by the network Web 2.0 technologies.  We will do our best to provide the product architectures and the expertise to partner with our customers in the implementation of these collaborative capabilities from a technology and business perspective.  We will also share with our customers how we have done this internally.  In short, we are going to attempt to execute a strategy over the next decade that is similar to what we did in the early 90s.  And, as we have said before, it powered our growth for a decade.
 Now, Frank, let me turn the call over to you. 

Frank Calderoni,  Cisco Systems - EVP & CFO    [4]

           Thank you, John.  I'm very pleased with our very strong results for Q2 FY10, which demonstrates our ability to execute on our innovation and operational excellence priorities within our business model.  Our results include the completion of our acquisitions of Starent and ScanSafe, which did close during the quarter.  Total revenue for the second quarter was $9.8 billion, an increase of approximately 8% year over year, well above our guidance provided last quarter of 1% to 4% year-over-year.
 Total service revenue was $1.8 billion, up approximately 6% year-over-year.  Total product revenue was $8 billion, up 9% year over year.  Switching revenue was $3.4 billion, an increase of 13% year-over-year.  Modular Switching revenue was up approximately 12% year over year, while fixed switching revenue increased 14% year over year.  With sequential revenue growth of 19%, this reflects the highest Q1 to Q2 sequential switching revenue growth in over a decade.
 Routing revenue was $1.6 billion, up 2% year over year, representing an increase of 12% year over year in high-end, a decrease of 14% in midrange, and a decrease of 11% in low-end.
 Advanced Technologies revenue totaled $2.4 billion, representing an increase of 1% year-over-year.  We saw increases in Unified Communications of 17% and Wireless of 9%.  We saw a year-over-year decline in video systems of 12%, and security was flat year-over-year.  Other product revenues totaled $604 million, an increase of 46% year over year.  Growth year-over-year was driven primarily by the inclusion of our acquisition of Pure Digital, which we closed late last fiscal year, along with continued growth in emerging technologies, which includes TelePresence and Unified Computing Systems among others.
 Sequentially our total revenue was up 9% quarter over quarter.  We saw sequential revenue increases across most product categories with good performance in fixed switching up 21% quarter over quarter (technical difficulty)-- switching up 18% quarter over quarter.  High-end routing, which includes our Starent acquisition is up 4% quarter over quarter, and video systems is up 26% quarter over quarter.  We experienced an increase in total revenue across all geographic segments on a year-over-year basis with the exception of Europe.  Year-over-year revenue ranged from a decline of approximately 3% in Europe to growth of approximately 16% for Asia Pacific Theater with revenue in the US and Canada Theater up approximately 12%, Japan up approximately 12%, and emerging markets up approximately 1%.
 Q2 FY10 total non-GAAP gross income was 65.6%.  That is down 0.7 percentage points quarter-over-quarter and up 1.6 percentage points year-over-year.  For product only non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter was 65.6%.  That was down 0.7% quarter over quarter.  For the quarter-over-quarter comparison, unfavorable mix and other manufacturing-related costs were partially offset by higher volume and cost savings.  While we were pleased with our overall performance in gross margins this quarter, we recognized that variability in product mix and other factors will impact gross margins.  On a year-over-year basis, non-GAAP product gross margins was up 2 points.
 Our non-GAAP service margin for the second quarter was 65.9%.  That is down from 66.3% last quarter and up from 65.7% in Q2 FY09.  The service margin decreased quarter over quarter was primarily driven by increased costs and a higher mix of advanced services, partially offset by volume.
 Total gross margin by theater ranged from approximately 63.2% for Asia Pacific to approximately 72.7% in Japan.  We saw variability in our margins across the theaters due to unfavorable mix and discounting, offset by cost savings and volume.  Gross margins on a quarter-over-quarter basis in emerging markets in Japan improved, while Asia Pacific, US and Canada and Europe declined.
 Non-GAAP operating expenses were approximately $3.5 billion in Q2 FY10.  That is up 4% quarter over quarter, driven by increased investments in our growth opportunities.  Non-GAAP operating expenses were down 2% year over year.  Our non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenue was 35.3% in Q2 FY10 versus the 37% in Q1 FY10.  Non-GAAP interest and other income was $23 million for Q2, and this amount reflects increased interest expenses on the $5 billion bond offering that we just completed this past November.
 GAAP interest and other income was a loss of $15 million for the second quarter and also includes a $38 million mark-to-market loss related to the transaction to hedge a portion of the foreign currency consideration for our pending acquisition of Tandberg.
 Our Q2 FY10 non-GAAP tax provision rate was 22%.  Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $2.3 billion, representing an increase of 25% year-over-year.  As a percentage of revenue, non-GAAP net income was 23.8%.  Non-GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis for the second quarter were $0.40 versus $0.32 in the second quarter of fiscal year 2009, a 25% increase year over year.  GAAP net income for the second quarter was $1.9 billion as compared to $1.5 billion in the second quarter of fiscal year 2009.  GAAP earnings-per-share on a fully diluted basis for the second quarter was $0.32 per share versus $0.26 per share in the same quarter of fiscal year 2009.
 Now moving into the balance sheet, our balance sheet continues to be very strong, providing us with significant financial flexibility.  In any rapidly shifting supply demand environment, such as the one we are currently experiencing, shifts in lead times, inventory levels and manufacturing outputs will occur.  For this quarter we did have a higher third month in terms of shipments than in previous second quarters as evidenced by our results in A/R and DSO.
 As we mentioned last quarter, we have experienced longer lead times on several of our products.  This was the result of increased demand driven by the improvement in our overall markets.  While we may continue to experience longer than normal lead times, our lead times improved throughout the quarter, and we expect them to continue to improve throughout the next quarter.
 The total of cash, cash equivalents and investments for the quarter was $39.6 billion, up approximately $4.3 billion from last quarter.  Of this total balance, $8.8 billion was held within the United States at the end of Q2 FY10.  We had a successful bond offering in November of 2009, which contributed approximately $5 billion to this cash balance.
 Additionally we closed our Starent and ScanSafe acquisitions, which resulted in a net use of approximately $2.3 billion of cash.  During the quarter cash flow from operations was approximately $2.5 billion.
 Moving on to Accounts Receivable, our Accounts Receivable balance was $4.2 billion at the end of Q2.  At the end of Q2 FY10, day sales outstanding, or DSO, was 39 days compared to 32 days in Q1 FY10 and 29 days in Q2 FY09.  The increase in DSO was driven by the shipment profile during the quarter and the seasonality of our service billings.  Total inventory at the end of Q2 was $1.2 billion, up approximately 12% quarter over quarter.  Non-GAAP inventory turns were 11.7 this quarter, up 4/10 of a point from last quarter and Q2 of last year.  Inventory purchase commitments at the end of Q2 were $3.3 billion, an increase of approximately 19% from the end of Q1 FY10 and an increase of approximately 25% year-over-year.
 For the quarter we repurchased $1.5 billion of common stock under the stock repurchase program or 63 million shares at an average price of $23.96 per share.  The remaining authorized repurchased amount under the stock repurchase program was approximately $11.6 billion at the end of the quarter.
 Deferred revenue was $9.7 billion at the end of Q2, an increase of approximately 4% compared with Q2 FY09.  Deferred product revenue was $3.3 billion, and deferred service revenue was approximately $6.3 billion, increases of approximately 3% and 4% year over year respectively.
 At the end of Q2, our headcount totaled 65,874, a net increase of approximately 2100 from last quarter, primarily as a result of our acquisitions of Starent and ScanSafe, as well as our investment in growth initiatives.  We expect our headcount to grow in support of our additional growth investments and have authorized 2000 to 3000 incremental external hires.  We anticipate adding this headcount in the next several quarters.
 In closing, from a financial perspective, we are very pleased with our Q2 results and the strong foundation from which we can continue to focus on growth and capturing market transitions in the industry.  We believe we are well positioned to move into market adjacencies with tremendous speed, scale and flexibility.  Our ongoing efforts to improve efficiency and productivity have allowed us to deliver a strong performance in Q2 but also positions us well for the future.  We will continue to make investments in innovation, operational excellence and our key growth opportunities.
 I will now turn it back to John. 

John Chambers,  Cisco Systems - Chairman & CEO    [5]

           Frank, congratulations and well done.  Now moving on to chapter three in our strategy, customer segments, geographic and product review.  Q2 continued the trend to balance between innovation and operational effectiveness in almost every aspect of our business.  In recent past conference calls, we have gone into certain amount of important discussions of our strategy, and we will continue this trend in most of our future calls.  However, given the strong results of this quarter, we think this strategy speaks for itself, and we will focus in this conference call on the normal customer segments, geographies and product results.
 Customer segments and geographies.  Now moving onto the customer segments where the discussion is on a global basis as measured by orders for what we call bookings from year-over-year and at times sequentially.
 During the month of January, I attended the World Economic Forum at Davos, interfacing with over 100 key customers, government leaders and industry subject matter experts.  I also traveled through a number of emerging countries where momentum is clearly starting to accelerate again and attended the Consumer Electronics Show as we continued to expand Cisco's presence into many market adjacencies even within the consumer market itself.  The feedback from customers in all major geographies and customer segments is rapidly improving in terms of their view of their own country, economic growth and their own business opportunities.  While almost all of these customers indicated Cisco's improving status in the organizations from both a technology and a business partner perspective, this is especially true in our service provider, enterprise and government accounts.
 On a global basis, our total product orders year over year were up 11%.  This was a major improvement in fiscal year 2010 Q1 over total product orders which in Q1 of this fiscal year were down in the high single digits.  And even more improvement when compared to Q4 -- boy, it seems like a long time ago, Frank -- fiscal year '09, which were down year over year in the low 20s from a positive 11 to minus 20.  And that is what you are seeing from us is the comfort level that we are seeing in terms of the balance performance across all key geographies and customer segments.
 Our service provider business on a global basis in terms of product orders in Q2 was up 11% year-over-year.  Our commercial was up 10%.  Enterprise was up approximately 7%, and consumer, including our Pure Digital acquisition, was up over 80%.  To again put this in perspective versus just one quarter ago in Q1 where our enterprise, including public sector, was down slightly year-over-year, consumer was up approximately 20%, and service provider and commercial were down in the low double digits.  This is obviously an inflection point in the market in all customer segments.
 First, in terms of the US it was a very strong quarter from both a year-over-year perspective and sequential improvement from Q1.  Order growth was approximately 17% year over year compared to Q1 year-over-year order growth, which was essentially flat.  Balance was good across industry segments with enterprise growing approximately 10%, public sector growing 2%, commercial growing in the mid-teens, and service provider growing in the low 20s from a year-over-year perspective.
 I would like to comment specifically on the service provider market where orders just two quarters ago were down over 30% year over year and last quarter were down in the high single digits.  This is one of the most robust positive turnarounds I have seen in my career.  I want to congratulate our service provider engineering, services and sales teams on just an outstanding result.
 Second, our business in Japan, despite the very challenging economic economy, continued to show solid improvements with order growth in the high teens year-over-year.  Congratulations there, well done.
 Asia-Pacific after being down in the low single digits in Q1 grew in the low double digits year over year in Q2 with both India and China starting to take off with growth respectively in the low 20s and in India and the high teens in China year over year.  We also saw emerging markets start to turn around, improving from Q1's negative growth year over year in the high 20s to this quarter's flat growth year-over-year led by countries like Brazil with growth of approximately 30%, and as you would expect in some very challenging economies such as Mexico, we are still experiencing negative growth, which was in the mid-teens.
 We continue to see the improvement in Europe that we shared with you last quarter.  Our European orders were up approximately 4% year over year, although the results vary dramatically between our large countries where you saw France grow year over year in the low double digits, the UK approximately flat year-over-year, Italy down in the mid-single digits, and Spain down in low double digits.
 From a product perspective, we saw dramatic year-over-year and sequential improvements, part of which Frank covered earlier, but I want to spend just a couple of more minutes on it.  Again, in terms of products, we will discuss fees in terms of revenue year-over-year.
 As you would expect, given product book-to-bill of approximately 1, product orders and product revenues in each of the product categories were relatively close in terms of year-over-year numbers.  Again, product revenues grew approximately 9% year over year, while orders grew approximately 11%.  Switching revenues were up approximately 13% with very good balance in modular and fixed, each having almost identical growth year-over-year numbers.  This is obviously a major improvement back to Q1 when switching revenues were down approximately year-over-year 21%.
 Routing revenues were up 2% again with dramatic improvement from Q1's negative 17% year over year.  High-end routing, as a reminder, represents about 2/3 of our total Routing business, and this quarter high-end routing includes the results of our Starent acquisition, grew 12%, again with an improvement versus Q1's minus 15.  The mid and low range router products were down in the low teens.  With the usual caveats, I would expect to see continued improvement in the routing numbers for several reasons.  First, given the uptake of our ASR 1000s.  Second, early indications of successful pilots and customer commitments for the ASR 9000.  And third, the very initial positive feedback and buy-in by key customers to our Starent acquisition.
 I'm pleased that the ASR 1000 was up almost 150% year over year, while the ASR 9000 results are still relatively low as expected in the early stage of the product lifecycle.  However, you can see the dramatic improvement starting to occur in terms of customer acceptance where in Q2 orders for the ASR 9000 were twice the revenues.
 Total Advanced Technology Q2 revenues were up approximately 1%, again a dramatic improvement from down approximately 15% year over year in Q1.  The trend was also evident in each of our Advanced Technology categories.  In terms of Advanced Technologies, Unified Communications was up 17% compared to Q1's negative 10%.  Wireless grew in the high single digits, continuing solid year-over-year results.  The network home was down approximately 6% compared to Q1 down 18%.  That does not include the Flip numbers obviously.  Security was flat compared to Q1's down 9%, and storage was down 1% to Q1's down 19%.  Video systems were down 12% compared to Q1's down 29% year over year, and finally, Application Networking systems was down 7% year over year.
 Other product areas that might be of interest to you would include Pure Digital's Flip, which had revenues of approximately $130 million and improvement from $50 million in Q1.  The Nexus 5000 and 7000 showed extremely strong year-over-year improvements as their customer acceptance dramatically increased with revenue growth of approximately 450% for the Nexus 5000 year over year and 140% for the 7000.  Our UCS numbers are still in the early stage of customer acceptance and pilots, but again showed sequential order growth rates of over 100%, and now over 400 customers have ordered from Cisco.
 In summary, although we would like to avoid the downturns, our vision of how the industry is going to evolve appears to be playing out very much as we expected.  We believe our differentiated strategy is also achieving the benefits to both Cisco and our customers that we thought were possible.  And finally, our execution is on target in terms of results measured from our customer partnership perspective, market share and share of our customers' total communications and IT expenditures as the network becomes the platform for delivering these capabilities.
 Now, Frank, I would like to turn it back over to you for additional details of financial guidance and other financial highlights. 

Frank Calderoni,  Cisco Systems - EVP & CFO    [6]

           Thank you, John.  You are very welcome.  Let me remind you again that our comments include forward-looking statements.  You should review our recent SEC filings that identify important risk factors and understand that actual results could materially differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements.  The guidance we are providing is on a non-GAAP basis with a reconciliation to GAAP.
 As John indicated, while we are optimistic about the recovery of the economy, the variability that still exists within the marketplace makes it challenging to predict demand and other related matters beyond a quarter at a time.  As such, we will only be providing guidance for our third quarter at this time and are approaching the second half of the fiscal year outlook with the realization that these remain at unknown levels of sustainability.  We would encourage each of our shareholders to be equally careful as they modeled the second half of the fiscal year.
 For Q3 FY10 we anticipate total revenue to be up approximately 23% to 26% year over year.  Every five to six years Cisco has an extra week in our third quarter.  In our guidance we have factored this extra week in both our revenue, as well as our operating expenses.  Although it is difficult to forecast the revenue impact of this extra week, we have anticipated a 2% to 3% sequential increase in revenue in our Q3 revenue guidance attributed to the extra week.
 As we have done in previous quarters, we will provide the details of the full impact of the extra week when we exit this quarter.
 At this point let me remind you that in light of Regulation FD, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done to an explicit public disclosure.
 Now let me give you additional details on the Q3 financial guidance.  As we have said in the past, forecasting gross margins has always been challenging due to various factors such as volume, product mix, variable component cost, customer and channel mix and competitive pricing pressure.  That being said, we believe total gross margin in Q3 will be approximately 64% to 65%, reflecting the revenue guidance I just shared with you.  With recent acquisitions and our continued growth into some lower margin markets, gross margin could be negatively impacted by product mix.
 We believe Q3 operating expenses will be approximately 36.5% to 37% of revenue.  We expect interest and other income to be approximately negative $10 million to negative $20 million in the third quarter, taking into consideration the interest expense associated with our debt offering.  Our tax provision rate for Q3 is expected to be approximately 22%.
 We are modeling share count to be down approximately 25 million shares quarter over quarter in weighted average shares outstanding for EPS purposes.  In this estimate of share count, we are not taking into consideration any further change in stock price that could occur in the third quarter of fiscal year 2010.  While we expect to continue our share repurchase program, it is difficult to predict the exact weighted average shares outstanding.  As a point of reference, a $1.00 movement in our average stock price would change the calculated shares outstanding for purposes of determining earnings-per-share by approximately $17 million.
 We are extremely pleased with our Starent acquisition and the positive customer acceptance.  As a reminder to our previous announcement during the close of the transaction, on an average moving forward in the near term, we expect the impact of Starent to be slightly dilutive to our non-GAAP EPS by a little less than $0.01 per share on a quarterly basis.
 Regarding cash flow from operations, we would expect to generate $2 billion to $2.5 billion during the third quarter.  For our Q3 FY10 GAAP earnings, we anticipate that GAAP EPS will be $0.06 to $0.08 per share lower than our non-GAAP EPS, primarily due to stock compensation expense and acquisition-related charges.  Please see the slides that accompany this webcast for further detail.
 Our GAAP guidance could vary significantly depending upon the potential positive or negative mark-to-market fluctuations relating to our transactions to hedge a portion of the foreign currency consideration for our pending acquisition of Tandberg.  Other than those items in the (technical difficulty)-- there are no other significant differences between GAAP and our non-GAAP guidance.  This guidance assumes no additional acquisitions, asset impairments, restructuring and tax or other events which may or may not be significant.
 I will now turn the call back over to John. 

John Chambers,  Cisco Systems - Chairman & CEO    [7]

           All right.  Thank you.  The following is a summary of my view of Cisco's momentum and opportunities entering Q3 of fiscal year 2010.  In Q1 it was a pleasure for the first time in over a year to say that our optimism applied as you would expect to not only the areas where we can control and influence but also with all the appropriate caveats those areas we cannot control and influence.
 Q2 clearly was another tipping point and highlighted in our opinion movement into the second phase of economic capital spending recovery marked by very good balance and very strong sequential year-over-year improvements in almost every area of our business.  Everything from our organization structure and business models to our acquisition strategies to our products and geographies and customer segments are delivering the results that we had hoped for.
 While no one knows for sure the strength of the recovery, job creation opportunities and the possibility of another downturn, we will continue to set our strategy and execute being very aggressive in both our investments and continued expansion in our 30 plus market adjacencies.  We are assuming an optimistic view of the economy and our execution capabilities.  If we get surprised, as I said earlier, we will simply adjust, and I think most of you agree we know how to do this effectively if necessary.
 As we said before, even if the market slowdown was to recur, we do not see this changing our long-term growth opportunities if we execute the way we have in prior slowdowns and assuming that the global economy continues to recover GDP growth rates similar to those in the middle of the last decade.  We continue to maintain our longer-term expectations of growth rates in the normal GDP growth time periods to be in the 12% to 17% range year-over-year with all of the appropriate caveats.
 It is also a pleasure to see our forecast returning to this growth range as well.  However, it is important to remember that we could be wrong, and we will adjust if we are.  On a global basis and a US basis, we saw improvements and at times dramatic improvements in many areas.  We also continue to see the same challenges and uncertainties from an economic job creation, political and capital spending perspective that many of you continue to witness.  However, on a global basis the trends were clearly an inflection point in a very positive way across almost all of our geographies, theaters, products, major countries and customer segments.
 Again, I want to thank the Cisco family for working together as a team to ensure that our Company is in a solid position to not only weather the challenging economic environment, but even more importantly to be ready to continue to accelerate our investments assuming the current trend continues.  I know it has not been easy, and we are all working hard to maintain our culture of innovation, trust, (inaudible) mentality and giving back, all during tough time periods of time for ourselves, our families and our friends.  As we continue to aggressively invest, we will also continue to maintain our focus on financial models.
 Once again, with our usual caveats as discussed earlier in our financial reports, our Q3 fiscal year 2010 guidance is for year-over-year revenue of 23% to 26% range.  However, it is simply too early to know what will be the rate of magnitude of the recovery and the extent of sustainability and what the recovery will look like throughout 2010.  While we expect a continued recovery throughout the entire year and clearly gave a very aggressive forecast for Q3, it is important that expectations not get ahead of market realities, especially until we see job creation.  We could see economic growth bounce up and down over the next 12 months, and we would strongly urge our investors to not dramatically change your models beyond Q3.  We will continue to share with you what we are seeing in the market and our own expectations for our business as transparently as we can.  We will focus on what we can control and influence and attempt to position Cisco to gain more market and market transitions whether they are industry consolidation, product innovation, market adjacencies opportunities or economic.
 In summary, for those areas that we control and influence, we believe our vision, strategy and execution are in great shape and producing results.  And for those areas that we cannot influence or control, at the present time we're also seeing positive improvements, solid improvement.
 We were extremely pleased with our very strong Q2 results and saw a number of positive signs this quarter in the economy and in our business, especially the sequential financial results and improvements from Q1 to Q2 fiscal year 2010.  If we continue to see these positive trends for the next several quarters, we believe there is a good chance we will be back to solid, sustainable, global economic growth.
 As always, I want to thank our shareholders, customers, employees and partners for their support and continued confidence in our ability to execute during rapid industry consolidation, market transition and challenging economic times.
 On a topic that touches all of us, our hearts go out to those affected by the devastating earthquake in Haiti.  It is in times like these that individuals and companies should continue to ask, what can I do to help?  So far Cisco, the Cisco Foundation and our employees have donated more than $2.3 million with additional investments in people, dollars and technology to relief organizations.  In partnership with the US government and NATO, we are also leveraging our routers and space technology with satellite access now up and operational for voice data and TelePresence access to remote areas across the region.  I want to thank the Cisco family for the investment and time we have given as a Company so far, and as we continue to contribute, I am very proud of the team's broad support of our corporate social responsibility initiative.  I would also like to encourage all of those listening on this call to contribute and encourage your employees to match your donations.  Together we really can make a difference.
 Now, Frank, I'm going to surprise you on this one.  One of the reasons I go to the World Economic Forum is to get to see a broad group of government leaders, business leaders and others.  At the forum, as you know, President Obama had asked prior President Clinton and prior President Bush to focus on helping to lead the efforts in Haiti.  President Clinton, and when I was meeting with him one evening, he said, John, you have all have traditionally been able to think out of the box in places like what was done in Lebanon or what was done after Katrina in Louisiana and Mississippi or what was done in China after the earthquake.  And he said what we need most is not immediate relief at this time from companies such as yours, although you are doing a good job on that.  He said think out of the box about how you really do job growth and sustainability after the rebuilding starts to take place, as much as we have done in other areas.  We put Randy Pond -- I gave him a call that Thursday night after the session with President Clinton, and we've got a working group there.  And Frank, I would like to challenge us to think out of the box and kind of put you on the spot here in terms of adding a little bit of money.  And silence will mean agreement here toward these efforts.  So I never ask our shareholders or our employees to do something we do not do ourselves.  But I would like to think creatively on what the two prior presidents have challenged a little bit about and think about people that are involved here.  Because it is easy -- no, it is less difficult to apply energy and focus to help at the time the challenge occurs.  But really the people need your help even much more to change their lives afterwards.  So we will try to lead by example.  Blair, you can be candid as always about how well we are doing that or not.
 With that, let me move on to our Q&A session and a healthy give-and-take.



Questions and Answers
Blair Christie,  Cisco Systems - SVP, Corporate Communications    [1]

     Great.  Thank you, John.  We are now going to open up the call for questions.  We do request that sell-side analysts please ask only one question.  So why don't you go ahead and open up to the first one? 

Operator    [2]

     Mark Sue, RBC Capital Markets. 

Mark Sue,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [3]

     Your confidence on the sustainability of your newfound strength, why so aggressive?  Are you going after share gains?  And do you feel that there is an underlying switch up-trade cycle on top of this broad regional recovery which implies less seasonal trends in the first half and accelerated topline trends in the second half? 

John Chambers,  Cisco Systems - Chairman & CEO    [4]

     A mouthful.  Let me go in the sequence that you raised.  The reason for the confidence is, when you see this type of balance across every single market segment, across all of our major theaters, across all of our key product areas, and you see the products begin to tie together, that combined with having talked to the government leaders -- that is the great thing about traveling around the world in January in emerging markets and established markets, but also meeting with the leaders from India, China, Mexico, the other parts of Latin America, Europe -- you good get a good feel for their business as well, and you see both their confidence in their economies, as well as the job creation and focus occur.
 So mathematically this should indicate a very solid recovery.  That does not mean we could not do things to misstep in the process.  But you look at the numbers, and every time we have seen anything close to this we have seen very solid recovery.  This time it was across the board in every category.  And while I'll think of some areas that we could probably be more critical on our sales team about getting more after, it feels very good.
 And then I think also the reason that you are seeing optimism on Cisco is our technologies tying together, customers get it, and our relationship and the service providers.  And we have probably talked 50 of the top service providers in the world over the last two months, and in almost every situation, both our technology role is dramatically changing, and our business partnership role was dramatically changing.  The same thing is true in government and other accounts.
 So what we can control or influence, room for improvement.  It is really going very well.  You see the almost skyrocketing -- Blair, I hate to use that word -- operating income, and you twitch when I say it.  But we're back to record profits, and we did that during a very tough time.  And that is still with allocating a future amount of our resources to parallel areas, new market adjacencies that don't get any revenue.  So our collaboration model is working.
 So long-winded answer to your question.  What we can control or influence.  We are hitting on all cylinders, and the market overall feels very solid.  And I see this across government and business leaders around the world.

Tal Liani,  Bank of America/Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [6]

     If the stock market is not going to reverse on these results tomorrow, then we do have a problem. 

John Chambers,  Cisco Systems - Chairman & CEO    [7]

     I will take that as a compliment.  It is not just results.  It is a balance.  It is what you're seeing on a global basis. 

Tal Liani,  Bank of America/Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [8]

     Yes.  My question is, first of all, just clarification, so it does not count as a question.  You spoke about the impact of Starent.  Investors do ask this evening how much of the resultant improvement is related to Starent and Tandberg acquisition?  If you can go back to the section and clarify it.  (multiple speakers) 

John Chambers,  Cisco Systems - Chairman & CEO    [9]

     Well, let's answer that, and then we will get to your question.  If you look basically, Tandberg is not going to be part and to approve by regulatory approval, which will occur hopefully -- and obviously it's not a given -- in the next three to four months.  And that is pretty much on case with where we are headed.  So none of the results tied to Tandberg directly or not directly on that, and that is still an open issue.
 In terms of Starent, it was just before Christmas when they were closed.  So from an overall results perspective, you had just about a month in terms of its contribution.
 Having said all of the above, I am going to make a question out of it.  What you are seeing is between our moves and mobility what we are doing at the edge of the networks in video and wireless.  You're seeing an architectural play where a year ago perhaps we were exposed in terms of our overall mobility strategy, and today there is not a service router in the world that does not feel we have got our act together pretty well here.  So let me stop there and go to what your question is. 

Tal Liani,  Bank of America/Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [10]

     My question is about (inaudible) inventory.  It went up nearly 50%, and we heard throughout the quarter about risk of component shortages.  First of all, can you comment about components, availability of components, and then explain the raw material inventory? 

John Chambers,  Cisco Systems - Chairman & CEO    [11]

     I will take the easiest part, the general question.  I will ask for Frank to comment specifically as it relates to inventory.
 When you rethink about what occurred during this quarter and in prior quarters both for suppliers of Cisco and the suppliers of the market, it always occurs this way.  As you start out, the market cuts back too much on capacity, including losing the people they are able to produce it.  As you start back up, you have more challenges with capacity.  And you also, especially on products that might be unique to one vendor or other where we have perhaps 50% more of the market, the challenges get a little bit more in that area.  That is just a normal economic recovery.  Our lead times did stretch out more than we would like, and you saw us bring those back toward the end of the quarter.  So let me have Frank comment specifically on the inventory. 

Frank Calderoni,  Cisco Systems - EVP & CFO    [12]

     As I mentioned in part of the script, we, as many in the industry have done over the past year, year and a half, pulled down very dramatically on our inventory last year based on what was happening in the economic downturn.  Now what we have seen in the last couple of quarters is increasing that.
 If you look at the profile of our inventory overall, it has increased in the last few quarters.  It is related primarily toward the upturn or the higher volume that we have been driving, as well as, as John just mentioned, the continued improvement in our lead times.
 So if I look at that profile whether it is raw materials or finished goods, it is nothing unusual based on what we are expecting over the next couple of quarters. 

John Chambers,  Cisco Systems - Chairman & CEO    [13]

     Yes, the number one challenge that I have asked Frank and Randy Pond and Angel Mendez to address is customer set.  I want the lead times tighter.  We made good improvement toward the end of the quarter.  I would like to see us continue that. 

Operator    [14]

     Jeff Evenson, Sanford Bernstein. 

Jeff Evenson,  Sanford Bernstein - Analyst    [15]

     You had a strong quarter in fixed switches this quarter.  I am wondering what factors led to that, and in particular if you could comment on the role of vendor-backed financing program that you have introduced and how you are accounting for that? 

John Chambers,  Cisco Systems - Chairman & CEO    [16]

     Okay.  I think what you are seeing is the switch is often tied to success in the enterprise, government and commercial markets, all of which went well for us on a global basis.  Secondly, I love our profit.  The market leadership looks good.  Our innovation engine is going very well.  Third is, as you do collaboration as the video starts to take off and integrated data voice video, most customers are looking at switches more than just a concentrator for one element of that.  It is the base on which we build our strategies for collaboration, security, video strategies and integration strategies.
 So I think part of it is just very good product execution, and Tony, if your team is listening, we are real excited about the innovation you have planned, and I think it's good execution in our accounts on it.  And so I think while it tends to be a little bit lumpy occasionally in this market, I'm very comfortable with where we are in the switching.  And I said that last quarter when the numbers were tough.
 So I think we feel pretty good about it.  Rob, anything you would add to that? 

Rob Lloyd,  Cisco Systems - EVP, Worldwide Operations    [17]

     Just, John, that we have obviously through the downturn continued to focus on the profitability with our channels and with our partners.  I think they have responded very well to those programs.  So, in addition to end-user focus, we have also been focusing on our partners and ensuring that they have got appropriate liquidity around the world, and I think that has paid off for us. 

John Chambers,  Cisco Systems - Chairman & CEO    [18]

     It really does because, especially as you all read and it was true in the market, for small businesses getting access to capital was a problem both in this country and around the world.  And so, Frank, your team has done a very good job on this, and it continues to be a good business, as well as the right thing to do. 

Blair Christie,  Cisco Systems - SVP, Corporate Communications    [19]

     He was looking for clarification on our vendor -- 

Jeff Evenson,  Sanford Bernstein - Analyst    [20]

     Yes, so as far as how we account for it. 

Frank Calderoni,  Cisco Systems - EVP & CFO    [21]

     So we do the vendor-backed financing, we have had that program in place for a number of years.  It runs through our Cisco Capital organization.  While we do offer various types of financing either directly with Cisco or through some of our partners, we account for it based on how we look at making the appropriate reserves based on the credit rating of the vendor that we are working with.  We are very conservative in how we account for it over a period of time.  We normally take reserves and defer it for the duration of the financing period.  So we feel very comfortable with how that continues to be accounted for. 

Operator    [22]

     Simona Jankowski, Goldman Sachs. 

Simona Jankowski,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [23]

     John, you made a comment on the call that you sound more excited about share gains in Routing and Switching going forward.  I think you talked a bit about that on Switching.  If you can expand there.  And also in particular on the Routing side because it looks like Routing was flat quarter on quarter, despite what seems to be a budget flush by a bunch of carriers and also pretty good results from other telecom-facing vendors.  If you can just give us a little more color on your optimism there? 

John Chambers,  Cisco Systems - Chairman & CEO    [24]

     Sure.  Going in somewhat in the reverse order that you raised, our service provider business, which is very strong around the world, in the US it was actually, as I said in terms of orders, up over 20% sequentially.
 In terms of the product side of the house, you are seeing our strength in the core routers.  I want to say the CRS -- and I want to check to be sure on this number -- we are up 30% sequentially.  So doing very well in our core router segment.  The Edge Routers, the 9000 is really a hot product, but it takes a while to work through the product cycle.
 So, as you start to put that into carriers, they put it into key pilot locations.  Then it begins to expand out beyond it.  But we are I think by far and away the industry leader now at the Edge, in which we were not before.
 The ARS 1000 I gave you the numbers.  Between the ARS 1000 and 9000, I think if I remember right, we had about 1200 customers a quarter ago, 1600 today.  So we are doing very, very well.  We are probably going to break a little bit more of the lower Edge access into different categories in future calls.  So we can talk about the CRS, the Edge routing, the access routing a little bit differently.
 In terms of our business and service providers, we have moved to an architectural business partner with them, and while it might surprise you, I gave you the number of the service routers.  Only about a third of our business and service providers is now routing.  About a fourth of it is now switching.  You then talk about security and services and others.  We are playing architecturally across the board very, very well with them.
 To the first part of your question, even though the numbers for us are very large in service providers, I think there are some quarters where video might have a good quarter.  That was true this quarter.  There are other quarters that if I were to call next quarter, I would be surprised if our switch -- I mean, sorry, if our router volume was not up very strongly in service providers.
 So even as big as we are, it might swing in groups, and I think the key takeaway here -- relationship with the service providers.  You talk to any of them, our relationship almost without exception is improving, and share of wallet is improving, and market share is improving.  So very comfortable and our strategy and direction, but I very much appreciate the healthy, healthy constructive questions.

Ittai Kidron,  Oppenheimer - Analyst    [26]

     Thank you and congratulations, guys, on a great quarter.  I wanted to dig in a little bit with regards to your guidance, Frank.  You mentioned a headcount increase, 2000 or 3000 over the next few quarters.  If I just take the midpoints of your guidance, there is about a 1% drop quarter-over-quarter in gross margin and about 2.6% in operating margin, which implies you are clearly loading a lot here in the OpEx.  Can you give us some more color on that ramp of 2000 or 3000 people, how much of it is front-loaded, the linearity of it, and some more color on fluctuations and verticals, where was the focus? 

Frank Calderoni,  Cisco Systems - EVP & CFO    [27]

     Sure.  So specifically as it relates to the OpEx from quarter to quarter, as you can see in Q2 over Q1, we have increased our OpEx significantly 4% quarter on quarter, and that was, as we articulated a quarter ago, we were starting to invest in the growth opportunities.  You can see that starting to come through.
 In addition to that, we also -- John last week and we reiterated on this call -- talked about 2000 to 3000 of incremental hires that we intend to do over the next couple of quarters.  We have already started some of that hiring.  We authorize that throughout the quarter.  Many of those hires have been extended, some are still in process, and we will continue to work through that.  So that cost will begin to come on -- the additional costs will come on this quarter.
 The second thing I will say, and if you look at the magnitude of 2000 to 3000, that is fairly significant from quarter on quarter.  1000 individuals per quarter could be in the range of about -- for a full quarter about $70 million right there in additional fully burdened costs.
 The second thing is we have some other non-headcount-related costs associated with the growth investments that we are continuing to invest in.  Advertising for one.  We began again last quarter with a whole campaign around Flip, as well as video.  We are going continue that throughout the year.  We have got prototypes and demos associated with some of our newer products, as well as many of the architectures that we are rolling out across our geographies.  We have got costs associated with our ERP upgrades.  This is on the whole point of operational excellence, investing in capabilities that are going to allow us to continue to improve our business models over the period of time.  That is substantial.
 And then the last thing that I would mention that is factored in there is $125 million in the quarter is related to the extra week that we've talked about, that 14th week. 

John Chambers,  Cisco Systems - Chairman & CEO    [28]

     So, on a transactional level, we got aggressive in our hiring over a quarter ago.  This last quarter our headcount increased by about 2100 people, and about half of those were from acquisitions, about half from regular hiring.  But what I am most comfortable with is, Frank, with the job you are doing in terms of -- we used to try to do this within sales and as an afterthought do it to engineering, and then if the product really did well, we did it in service.  Then we think about channels.  We now move as a group when we make investments across the entire company at the same time, and Frank does that unbelievably well.  The best we have ever done in terms of as we put incremental money in place, it is not just about one aspect.  It goes across the board on it.

     A question around data center switching, specifically Nexus.  Some pretty strong growth there in your numbers year on year I think you were talking.  Talk about how Nexus is looking into this quarter, when will this become significant?  Do you see it as $1 billion in revenues this year for that platform?  And then also I think 400 customers, do you see that is a double from last quarter, and how is that coming along? 

John Chambers,  Cisco Systems - Chairman & CEO    [32]

     Yeah, I don't know if we gave you the customer numbers for last quarter.  We gave you the revenues.  We said the business doubled from last quarter.  I would expect probably the customers more than doubled.  But let's keep the math simple.  The business doubled from last quarter, and our customers up to 400 are on the next quarter.  We will give you a little bit more detail.
 In terms of the basis for the Nexus, in terms of a $1 billion run rate, I feel very comfortable we will be on that in this calendar year.  In fact, we are rapidly closing on that already.
 So in terms of the data center area, we are starting to win the architectural battles.  You are seeing the value on BTE with EMC and VMware.  You are seeing that it is not about servers, stand-alone technology -- we have no interest in that -- but architectural plays.  We are off to a good start.  We have got some tough competition there, but I like the way the hand plays out.  And even Frank would say my forecast I just gave you on $1 billion this year was probably sandbagged even more than your cash flow projections (multiple speakers) periodically are by quarter. 

Frank Calderoni,  Cisco Systems - EVP & CFO    [33]

     Yes, we go back and forth on cash flow.

     Just a quick clarification and then a question.  Was there any revenue benefit on the accounting changes you mentioned last quarter was about $50 million?
 And my question is, if I look at the revenue guidance for the April quarter and I adjust -- well, if I look at it historically over the last five years and I strip out last year due to the recession, it is typically up about 3%.  And then if I look at the guidance you gave and adjust for the one extra week, it kind of implies something much less than that.  Any reason why we shouldn't look at the historical average?  I'm just trying to get a sense of how you came up with this guidance based on the strong orders and the momentum, and then if I look at the historical average, it seems to be lower.  Thank you. 

John Chambers,  Cisco Systems - Chairman & CEO    [36]

     Alright.  A couple of general thoughts.  I'm going to answer the easy part, and Frank, you can get the number one because I'm not sure on that one.  If you watch, you remember Cisco is always going to be conservative.  We are very comfortable with our momentum and direction at this point in time, and we are hitting on all cylinders.  But also understand everything went our way this last quarter -- every geography, every product area, etc.
 In terms of the economic environment, it is still a little bit challenging, and we are still watching supply chain leadtimes.  But we did do improvements into this quarter as I think it was marked challenges a little bit on.  So book-to-bill we are usually with a little bit higher book-to-bill going into the next quarter than we are.  I would read it just as very solid growth opportunities, very comfortable returning to our guidelines.  But I know many of you perhaps challenge us, would we be able to hit, which I now feel pretty good about being able to hit, and I would not read anything negative into it.  All positives from my perspective.  Just we do not want people to get too far ahead of our ability to deliver in terms of direction.
 Frank? 

Frank Calderoni,  Cisco Systems - EVP & CFO    [37]

     So your question related to the accounting change that we implemented at the beginning of the fiscal year.  So last quarter, the first quarter, we said it was approximately $50 million of benefits.  And the current quarter is about half that, so approximately $25 million. 

John Chambers,  Cisco Systems - Chairman & CEO    [38]

     But if you look overall to the second part of your question, we, during periods of economic change up or down, we encourage you to watch sequential numbers.  But just once we get into our normal rhythm, which we are back in, we go right back to year over year.  So, rule of thumb, during the elbows up or down, what we call the tipping point -- sequential is important during normal operations, which I would now say we're moving into.  I would watch year-over-year numbers in terms of the direction.  I would not read as much into a couple of points one way or the other on sequential.

Sanjiv Wadhwani,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [40]

     You guys have done a great quarter guys.  John, a quick question on service provider.  Orders are up really nicely.  Can you talk about the April quarter, and just in looking at the orders, was that CRS one related, ASR switching, video, Starent, any color over there? 

John Chambers,  Cisco Systems - Chairman & CEO    [41]

     All of the above.  If you look at the quarter coming up to us in front, it is traditionally a very solid quarter for service provider for us from a seasonal point of view.  It also speaks to the service providers feeling more comfortable with their business and more comfortable candidly with government regulations within their business.  And I do think you will see a very good balance, although it tends to be a little bit more this next quarter, Rob, if I were looking out, more routers if we look into our forecast and begin to break it down.  But no, I think it's very good balance across the board.  Remember again, the mix that I gave you earlier with only about a third of our service provider business being routing, substantial part being video, a substantial part being switches, etc. 

Operator    [42]

     Paul Silverstein, Credit Suisse. 

Paul Silverstein,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [43]

     If I could ask a clarification and then a question.  First off, tell us what the total present contribution was, and what you expected ScanSafe and what ScanSafe did last quarter?
 And then the question is, it looks like the strength -- I understand your comment about broad-based, but it looks like US is leading, and it's also switching in routing.  Which if that shrink continues into this quarter, from a product mix perspective, putting aside Flip and the other lower margin stuff you have acquired recently, one would think that would actually be -- would benefit margins.  I'm trying to understand maybe, Frank, if you could give us a breakdown or some type of quantification of the impact of the geographic, the expected product mix and the volumes, that would be appreciated. 

John Chambers,  Cisco Systems - Chairman & CEO    [44]

     Okay.  So if you look overall geography-wise, the US absolutely led early in the economic recovery.  And if you watch on the numbers with our growth being up approximately 17% year over year, that was an extremely strong number.  But it was very well balanced across our enterprise, commercial accounts, federal business, etc.  within the category.  But you saw very good movement in the emerging markets being from down in the high 20s just a quarter or two ago and very painful to flat.  And, as I shared with you on the tours I have made through the emerging markets and meeting with a lot of the government and business leaders in emerging markets just last week, that is headed in the right direction.
 Asia Pacific beginning to pick up very good balance using our approach in China and India.  China did the best stimulus spending in my opinion in the world and positioning for that.  They spent it quickly.  They realigned their resources quickly.  You saw the business turn up earlier.  Their growth this quarter was in the high teens.
 India, with their elections occurred in May, they needed to get stability.  We said that's going to cause a little bit of lagging.  You did see the last quarter their growth in the low 20s.  So I think you are seeing very good balance around the world.  Japan I'm not quite as optimistic on the economy, but candidly [Ed Zart] and team are executing off the charts over there in terms of direction. 

Blair Christie,  Cisco Systems - SVP, Corporate Communications    [45]

     You asked about TelePresence. 

John Chambers,  Cisco Systems - Chairman & CEO    [46]

     And so if you look at TelePresence, it is the tip of the iceberg for catching what collaboration means.  And so it is the way of getting people to understand collaboration, the expansion.  We're up over 550 customers.  You will see us announce this year our first customers in the 100 million and probably well beyond type of announcement.  Customers do get the balance between the value of Cisco TelePresence at the high-end and Tandberg at the middle and access level and the interoperability and the openness between the two.  So I'm very comfortable with where we are in TelePresence and the momentum, and it is accelerating within our own use. 

Paul Silverstein,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [47]

     John, can you give us a solid number for TelePresence for the quarter? 

John Chambers,  Cisco Systems - Chairman & CEO    [48]

     No, but I will give it for you for next quarter. 

Frank Calderoni,  Cisco Systems - EVP & CFO    [49]

     Back on following the question as it relates to margins, I think -- 

John Chambers,  Cisco Systems - Chairman & CEO    [50]

     I'm sorry, Paul, you are not that direct.  Blair kicked me underneath the table.  We will do an in-depth discussion of TelePresence in the next quarter.  Forgive my directness on that. 

Frank Calderoni,  Cisco Systems - EVP & CFO    [51]

     So back on the gross margin, I think your question related to the geography.  And, as you know when I mentioned in the script the improvement in margin overall in some of the geographies, I think you're probably referring to the improvement that we saw in the emerging markets, which probably has the most dramatic improvement from a quarter over quarter standpoint.  That clearly has to do with the business that John was talking about in emerging markets.  That business was down for a couple of quarters, and based on the volume and based on some of the challenges from a credit perspective overall, that puts pressure on margin.  And, as that business starts to come back, as we saw this past quarter and the solid business that we had, it really helps us from a margin perspective.  That was driving that.
 Answering your question overall from a margin perspective, as I said, when you start looking at some of the dynamics, a lot of it has to relate to the variability on the mix with some of our business over a period of time as we have seen in the last couple of quarters, and you saw that going from Q1 to Q2 in the overall margin drop.  We start to see consumer.  We start to see UCS.  We start to see the video business with set-top boxes, start to have more of a play in that variability.
 Over a longer period of time, as we said in the guidance for this coming quarter, as well as longer-term, as I mentioned back in December as part of the financial analyst conference, we really have to look at our margins in that 64% to 65% range because of that variability on mix because of some of the dynamics that occur with pricing, as well as with costs on the manufacturing side, and we feel comfortable over that period of time that that range is a reasonable range for us and for you to assume. 

John Chambers,  Cisco Systems - Chairman & CEO    [52]

     It is a fair question, Paul.  If you look at it as, especially in emerging markets and some of the areas that are not emerging, we are seeing some very good but very tough price competition from some of our competitors out of China, and we also are anticipating successful launches in home TelePresence -- don't avoid your topic -- and the implementation and in the early movement to markets.  And each time we have entered new markets and product areas where we have not been before, at first the margins are not quite what we would like, but then they built up over a period of time.
 So when I'm modeling Cisco, I would hold us accountable as a leadership team to say in the 64%, 65% range.  There might be short periods we are a little bit above and short periods below, but that is what Frank and I are trying to balance on this.  So I don't get particularly excited or over concerned in a quarter when it's just a little bit above it or below it. 

Paul Silverstein,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [53]

     John, using your reference, that is in Switching and Routing in your core platforms? 

John Chambers,  Cisco Systems - Chairman & CEO    [54]

     The question, Paul? 

Paul Silverstein,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [55]

     The price pressure you noted coming out of Asia, that is in Switching and Routing platforms? 

John Chambers,  Cisco Systems - Chairman & CEO    [56]

     No, it is across the board, and it is often in turnkey scenarios.  Somebody can go in and bid a whole architecture for mobile, and we're hitting for a piece of it.  So pricing pressure and that's how a certain set of competitors will come at you.  Some others will come at you with specific products, especially startups.  Others will come at us on the total systems integration type of approach.  And I think we are just seeing more systems play than before, and within the systems play, there is going to be more advanced services and other categories.  So we are really positioned well in this, but I think we are seeing different ways that competitors are coming at us, and price will always be one of the elements they come at us on. 

Operator    [57]

     Richard Gardner, Citigroup. 

Richard Gardner,  Citigroup - Analyst    [58]

     Well, most of my questions have been answered, but I did want to ask you where you are seeing the most success in UCS?  You are obviously on a pretty good trajectory there quarter to quarter.  Where are you seeing the most success in terms of applications and workloads?  Can you talk about who you go up against most often in competitive bidding situations and why customers choose UCS over competing products when they (multiple speakers) your product? 

John Chambers,  Cisco Systems - Chairman & CEO    [59]

     Let me take a little bit of cut at it, but I want to also not mislead you.  We are just up to 400 customers.  Most of those are doing pilots and implementation.  How the first couple of dozen go into the big accounts, service providers and enterprise determine how your next wave goes.
 Why we are winning?  It is an architectural play.  First, it is a very world-class product, which in my opinion one that is well ahead of our competitors at this point in time.  But it is the architecture and how the network and processing capability and storage capability comes together with the applications and the cloud and the ability to build the architectures where many of the customers are doing this.  Others are doing it, and we have been surprised a little bit, Rob, from the commercial marketplace with some really (inaudible) commercial customers just saying, hey, you save so much in terms of my support costs, so much on flexibility, and you're headed to where you're going to go without locking in and best-in-class products in each category.  We are going to align with you.
 I probably would say I owe Paul a discussion on TelePresence for the next quarter call.  We are probably two quarters out from being able to do the same meaningful discussion on the UCS side of the house.  But what I think you can say is that we are not only holding our own in the datacenter and virtualization, what you started with cloud and what we're really driving through, we're having very good success with.
 But again, in summary, we are going to have a great set of competitors in each product category area, and the good news is we do not like for competitors at all across many areas.  We are talking literally dozens of different competitors in different product categories. 

Operator    [60]

     Simon Leopold, Morgan Keegan. 

Simon Leopold,  Morgan Keegan - Analyst    [61]

     Sticking on this theme of competitors, John, many of us worried about the shifting competitive dynamics, specifically the reactions to your data center initiatives by IBM and Hewlett-Packard.  Can you help us quantify your exposure to these past partners and help us understand how this trends over the next number of quarters? 

John Chambers,  Cisco Systems - Chairman & CEO    [62]

     I have a huge amount of respect for both HP and IBM.  HP is clearly a competitor.  IBM is a partner and a competitor at times.  Rob and I were reviewing the impact that it has had.  Remember again, we usually create the demand and fulfill it through partners.  I would say our impact when we looked at the numbers was not major at all.  We are doing extremely well.  And we are also doing very well with our new introduction of new systems integrators and new partners.  I think it is just part of normal evolution.  It speaks to how key the network is to whether you are doing a cloud strategy, whether you are doing a video strategy, whether you are doing a security strategy, whether you are combining so that any device gets any content, and it is transparent to you where the processes are, the data is stored, the application occurs.  Intelligent networks is what makes it go.  And that is in part the reason you see us being so successful in service providers.
 We have the same goal: intelligence throughout the network and the ability to route any information from any device to any content and video data or voice.  It is a nice way of saying that the shifting competitive landscape, that is when you move into good markets, when your top competitors focus on you, that is a compliment.  When Apple brings maybe for the first time that I remember the Flip product on [Phase Net], on one hand I said, tremendous compliment, and I thank Steve for that.  And then he whacked us, as I knew he would.  But we are more than holding our own there as well.
 We have got our second generation product out, and Ned, maybe in that, just as an example, I am going to ask you to comment about how we're doing in the consumer space as an example where we are facing new competitors we have not seen before and a little bit of update on the home.  But we could have the same discussion on security.  We could have the same discussion in terms of where we are going in service providers, the same discussion in cloud.  The great news is we have a lot of different competitors in each category.  The key takeaway is we have a lot of different competitors in each category.  We are playing architecturally across them and changing our business models.
 A quick update on consumer where it is something there that we want to see, not counting set-top boxes go from the billion to our stretch goal 3 to 5 to 10.  How are we doing, and what kind of grade would you give us so far? 

Ned Hooper,  Cisco Systems - Chief Strategy Officer & SVP, Consumer Business    [63]

     Thanks, John.  So, as you mentioned, John, in your remarks, we spent some time together at the Consumer Electronics Show at the beginning of January.  And I think what we saw at CES was the strategy that we have laid out where we are focused on that intersection of video and networking for consumer experiences is really starting to resonate, not only with consumers -- and we saw that in the numbers and the results this quarter relative to our video products, both the Flip products, as well as the overall video systems products as you talked about.  Also, our story resonating strongly with partners, media companies, the service providers and some of the fantastic meetings we had.  Our focus is to deliver compelling experiences around personal video, branded video and video communications for consumers, and we feel very good about how that is playing out right now. 

John Chambers,  Cisco Systems - Chairman & CEO    [64]

     The exciting part is we started each of these market adjacencies, and very few people I think both inside and outside the Company understood how sports and entertainment ties to music, ties to film, ties to Flip video, ties to the home entertainment capability and the virtual capability, the self-installing capability of any device, any content.  And that is clearly the road that Ned has taken us on in terms of the architecture.  But each of our groups are now starting to come together on it, and customers get it.  That is the exciting thing.
 So we will see if it plays out as well as we think.  This is a new arena for us, and I'm sure we are going to do some things brilliantly, and then we are going to probably make some mistakes.  If we knew what the mistakes are, we would not make them.  But I feel very good with where you are taking us, Ned.  But also how well you're working with Dan Scheinman's group, how well you're working with our core groups, and service providers as well. 

Blair Christie,  Cisco Systems - SVP, Corporate Communications    [65]

     I think we have time for two more questions, John.  So can we take the next question, please? 

Operator    [66]

     John Marchetti, Cowen & Co. 

John Marchetti,  Cowen & Co. - Analyst    [67]

     John, just a quick question for you.  As you are looking into the second half of your fiscal year here and maybe a little bit further into the calendar year, I know you are not giving guidance.  But how should we -- you know given the product sets that you have got coming out now, a lot of new product traction -- how should we look at about maybe service provider versus enterprise, where are you expecting strength there?
 And then secondly, on that service provider business and of relatively conservative guide here given everything we have seen, is there any concern at all in that guide or anything factored in there about some concerns around budgets maybe being delayed in terms of approvals or where you are seeing those numbers fall out among some of your larger customers? 

John Chambers,  Cisco Systems - Chairman & CEO    [68]

     Well, the exciting thing is, John, I feel very good in terms of the growth in all the categories that we talked about.  And while the consumer is still a relatively small percentage of our business, actually I think what Ned and Jonathan have been able to do there looks very good as well.
 Some quarters tend to be more service provider oriented; some tend to be more enterprise oriented.  Some of them depend on which countries, the swing is up or down or not.  But I think you now see while we have been so comfortable with the 12% to 17% long-term growth guidance is that we are very well-balanced across each of these categories.  And we are the only player that has not only invested and bent across each of these segments from the consumer to the commercial to the service provider to the enterprise with a strategy that actually ties any device to any content anywhere in the world.  That is going to be hard to replicate by others.
 So when you think about my view of things saying growth in the 12% to 17% level is just a B+, A- type of execution for us over the next two to three years assuming normal GDP growth, you see why the confidence is there.  I do not look too much to one quarter slightly up or down or do we pull -- or do we have a little bit of capabilities in this quarter as we load leadtimes versus another quarter.  You put the two quarters together, they are extremely aggressive, and I think our trends are very good.  So assuming there's not a surprise in the market, I feel very good about our direction and momentum, John.  I would not read anything into caution on any category, and I don't see a problem with any of our major market segments or candidly any of our major countries.  I think we are executing pretty well in most of them. 

Blair Christie,  Cisco Systems - SVP, Corporate Communications    [69]

     We have time for one final question. 

Operator    [70]

     Paul Mansky, Canaccord Adams. 

Paul Mansky,  Canaccord Adams - Analyst    [71]

     In under the wire.  Thanks a lot.  I appreciate it.  Obviously the successes you are seeing are pretty clear to all of us.  So if I could could, can I play a bit more of a devil's advocate here?  We have heard about inventory build based on what you're saying over two to three quarters.  You are hiring again.  You have historically been very contemplative about hiring practices up and down.  We are shifting back to year over year growth focus.  What is it that you need to see to actually go back out and reestablish more of a fiscal year annual guidance? 

John Chambers,  Cisco Systems - Chairman & CEO    [72]

     Well, we are moving to a fiscal year annual guide in terms of the 12% to 17% number, and that is during normal times.  We have some quarters coming up that have very good comps year-over-year.  So we clearly forecast with that with 23% to 26% this next quarter.  And we said there -- and thank you for the clarification, Paul, on it -- that we wanted a couple of quarters more before we begin to think about are we in that range sustainable.  I think we will be barring an economic surprise or barring a mis-execution from our side on the overall approach.
 So again, if you take a step back, the quarter was probably as balanced as I have ever seen at Cisco, especially given the trends sequentially as well as year-over-year.  We will now move back into thinking a year at a time.  You know we don't run this company on this month or this quarter or even this year.  We are going to run it on the growth rates for the long-term and growth rates top and bottom line within the balance, that we are going to move aggressively on movements into new market segments, market adjacencies, and we're going to spend the money to get there, and we will try to give you a better feel for when we are more comfortable with the overall global economy being sustainable.  Clearly the signals to us are extremely good this quarter.  And I'm hard-pressed to think of a single country leader or government leader, business leader that I called on that was not more optimistic about their country momentum or their business momentum now versus just six months ago in terms of direction.
 So a couple of more quarters from that, and I think will give you long-term guidance.  We will have to decide, Frank, do we want to give long-term guidance by quarter?  That is kind of I think more than what most other people are doing, but we will take a hard look at the balance.
 So I want to thank everyone today for the time.  I am very much appreciative of the confidence you have shown in Cisco.  We are doing our best to show you the results from it, and I want to congratulate the Cisco team on a very good execution.
 So Blair, let me turn it over to you for the close.
