Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

           Good day and welcome to the Amazon quarterly conference call.  Today's call is being recorded.  At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms.  John Felton, Director of Investor Relations.  Please go ahead, sir. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Felton,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

           Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2011 financial results conference call.  Joining us today are Tom Szkutak, our CFO, and Rob Eldridge, our VP of Investor Relations.  We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.
 The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 26, 2011 only, and will include forward-looking statements.  Actual results may differ materially.  Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.  During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures.  In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.  Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2010.
 Now I'll turn the call over to Tom. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP and CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

           Thanks, John.  I'll begin with comments on our first- quarter financial results.  Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 9% to $3.03 billion.  Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 18% to $1.9 billion.  Return on invested capital of 24% down from 45%; ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends.
 The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 466 million shares compared with 463 million shares.  Worldwide revenue grew 38% to $9.86 billion or 36%, excluding the $144 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates.  We're grateful to our customers, who also continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection, and shipping offers.
 Media revenue increased to $3.96 billion, up 15%, or 13% excluding foreign exchange rates.  EGM revenue increased to $5.59 billion, up 59%, or 57% excluding foreign exchange.  Worldwide EGM increased to 57% of worldwide sales, up from 49%.  Worldwide unit growth was 51%.  Active customer accounts exceeded 137 million.  Worldwide active seller account were more than 2 million.  Seller units were 33% of total units.
 Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation.  Cost of sales was $7.61 billion or 77.2% of revenue compared with 77.1%.  Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content, and G&A combined was $1.78 billion or 18.1% of sales, up 234 basis points year-over-year.  Fulfillment was $831 million or 8.4% of revenue compared with 7.4%.  Technical content was $518 million, or 5.3% of revenue compared with 4.5%.  Marketing was $320 million or 3.2% of revenue compared with 2.7%.
 Now I'll talk about our segment results.  Consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments, our stock-based compensation, or other operating expense line items.  In the North America segment, revenue grew 45% to $5.47 billion.  Media revenue grew 18% to $1.89 billion; EGM revenue grew 63% to $3.3 billion, representing 60% of North America revenues, up from 54%.  North America segment operating income increased 6% to $290 million, a 5.3% operating margin.
 In the international segment, revenue grew 31% to $4.39 billion.  Adjusting for the $141 million year-over-year favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 27%.  We estimate that the international revenue growth rate was negatively impacted by approximately 500 basis points following the earthquake and subsequent events in Japan.
 Media revenue grew 13% to $2.07 billion or 9%, excluding foreign exchange.  EGM revenue grew 54% to $2.29 billion or 49%, excluding foreign exchange.  EGM now represents 52% of international revenues, up from 44%.  International segment operating income decreased 25% to $175 million, a 4.0% operating margin.  Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange, international segment operating income decreased 28%.
 CSOI decreased 8% to $465 million or 4.7% of revenue, down 239 basis points year-over-year.  Excluding the $7 million favorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI decreased 9%.
 Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation and other operating expense.  GAAP operating income decreased 18% to $322 million or 3.3% of net sales.  Our income tax expense was $89 million in Q1 or a 29% rate for the quarter.  The tax provision for Q1 2011 includes income tax expense of approximately $8 million related to a discreet item in the quarter.  GAAP net income was $201 million, or $0.44 per diluted share compared with $299 million and $0.66 per diluted share.
 Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $1.82 billion year-over-year to $6.88 billion.  Inventory increased 59% to $2.89 billion, and inventory turns were 11.6, down from 12.6 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels, and introduced new product categories.  Accounts Payable increased 53% to $5.54 billion and Accounts Payable days increased to 66 from 59 in the prior year.
 Our Q1 2011 capital expenditures were $298 million.  The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, including investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web services, capacity to support our fulfillment operations and investments in corporate office space.
 I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance.  Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe to date to be appropriately conservative assumptions.  Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including the high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending.  It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
 As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling into Company balances and foreign currencies among subsidiaries; unfavorable resolution of legal matters; and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance.  Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments; record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates; and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
 For Q2 2011, we expect net sales of between $8.85 billion and $9.65 billion or growth between 35% and 47%.  This guidance anticipates approximately 640 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange.
 GAAP operating income to be between $95 million and $245 million or between 65% decline and 9% decline.  This includes approximately $180 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.  We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $275 million and $425 million, or between a 32% decline and 5% growth.
 We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection, and convenience.  We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.
 Thanks.  With that, John, let's move to questions. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Felton,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

           Great.  Thanks, Tom.  Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call.  Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?



================================================================================
Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Yes, sir.  (Operator Instructions).  Spencer Wang, Credit Suisse. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spencer Wang,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Thanks for taking the question.  Two quick questions for Tom.  Can you just maybe elaborate a little bit on your 2Q guidance and what you're thinking the impact from Japan could be?  And how you're thinking about when you incorporate that into your guidance?
 And then, secondly, on shipping, the losses seem like they're growing.  So I was wondering if you could just talk, Tom, about, is that a function of more prime usage, faster shipping or fuel costs perhaps impacting that line?  Any more detail there would be great.  Thanks. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP and CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Sure.  In terms of your first question, what we saw for Japan -- first of all, I'll talk just briefly about Q1 and then I'll talk about Q2.
 Q1, in terms of impact, we think the impact is approximately 500 basis points on international revenue; because if you take a look at international revenue growth, excluding foreign exchange, it was up 27%.  So but for the unfortunate events in Japan, it would have been approximately 32%.  The impact on Q1 in terms of consolidated segment operating income is approximately $20 million.
 What we saw post the events, we certainly saw a pretty sizable slowdown for the few weeks ending the quarter.  What we've seen since then so far quarter-to-date has been that, certainly, our growth rates have picked up, but they're not at the rates they were previous to the events.  So, again, we're seeing positive growth there but not the growth rates we were seeing prior to that.  And so what we believe for the quarter, along with all of our other assumptions, are included in the guidance that we've given today.
 In terms of your second question related to shipping profit, what you're really seeing there is customers are coming out in great numbers with all of our -- adopting all of our free shipping programs, including Amazon Prime.  And you're, of course, seeing great adoption there and that's really what's driving those numbers. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     And ladies and gentlemen, we also ask that you please limit yourself to your question, so that everyone will have a chance to ask a question today.  You may return to the queue for follow-up questions.  We'll go next to Jeetil Patel with Deutsche Bank. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jeetil Patel,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Great, thanks.  A couple of questions.  One, I guess when you look at your -- it looks like the international business is really starting to kick in nicely, and it seems like Amazon Prime has now had a chance to really mature and ramp up in a lot of your regions.  I'm curious, are you seeing the same type of returns that you saw in the US market, in terms of customer adoption, purchase frequency in the international markets around Prime?
 And second, it seems like Kindle, you're kind of employing a same -- similar strategy that you did with Prime, which is stagger versus the US market.  And is it almost following the same path of ramp and returns for the Kindle initiatives globally, as you saw in the US market? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP and CFO    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     In terms of your first question, Jeetil, related to Prime, we are seeing these similar dynamics.  We are seeing customers love Prime in all geographies that we've offered it in.  We are seeing great cross-shopping of this happening, so customers really like the program.  And obviously, we have different offers depending upon geography, but we're very pleased with what we're seeing so far.
 In terms of Kindle, we've seen tremendous growth, both from a device standpoint as well as unit standpoint, in terms of digital books in the US.  And where we're now offering it outside of the US, we're seeing the same; even though it's very early, we're seeing great adoption and growth there.  So we're very, very happy to see the progress that we've made.
 One thing that we're doing -- obviously, you probably saw the launch related to -- the announcement related to Kindle's special offers, we actually will start shipping tomorrow.  The team did a nice job of moving the dates up from several days from now to start shipping tomorrow.  So very pleased to be able to offer that and excited about that offering.

     Mark Mahaney, Citi. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Mahaney,  Citigroup - Analyst    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Thanks.  Two quick questions.  That 51% unit growth seems like a real outlier.  You haven't had that kind of unit growth in the past.  Is there something in there that's unusual?  Something in there that's one time-ish?  Something in there that tells -- would have you warn people to think that that's not a sustainable growth level?
 And then very recently you had something of an outage in Amazon Web Services field.  Was that a demand problem, which is not necessarily a bad thing?  Or are there certain efficiencies that you needed to -- or inefficiencies that you needed to address that have been fixed?  Thanks. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP and CFO    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Probably the best way to answer the unit growth rate is if you take a look at what we saw in Q4, which is 43% growth rate.  We saw nice acceleration from 43% to 51% in Q1.  What you're seeing there is we saw great growth across the business, but the biggest thing you're seeing is that, which is primarily the consequence of growth of our digital business -- that's what you're seeing in the growth rate, the acceleration in growth rate down from Q4 to Q1.
 In terms of AWF, again, the team is working very deliberately on the way to identify and validate and fix the root causes associated with this incident.  And that's what they're working on.  And I don't really have a lot to add to that at this time.

     Youssef Squali, Jefferies. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Youssef Squali,  Jefferies & Company - Analyst    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Thank you very much.  Two quick questions.  First, the midpoint of guidance for Q2 implies margins about 1.8%.  So x-SBC, where's the other 150 bps or so of additional spend going?  How much of that is on recurring things like the 4,200 people or so you hired in the quarter versus any one-time items?
 And second, on the state tax issue, how big is it a -- or big a concern is it to you, how big an advantage do you believe you've enjoyed so far from not paying taxes in those states?  I guess, in other words, would you have been able to grow at the rates you have been growing that, if taxes were levied across -- on your business across the US?  Thanks. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP and CFO    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Sure.  In terms of your first question, we're not breaking out the individual line items, if you will, for operating expenses, but if you take a look at what we saw in Q1, you're seeing that we've added a lot of capacity.  You see that in our CapEx and you also see the fulfillment capacity; you see it in our CapEx and you also see it in the fulfillment line item.  We added 13 fulfillment centers last year.
 If you take a look at the announcements that we've had to date, we're adding nine fulfillment centers this year.  Those are the ones that we've announced.  With the growth rates we're seeing, you should expect, if it were to continue, you should see more than that this year as well -- more than the nine.  So that's what you're seeing in the Q1.  And you're also seeing that reflected in the Q2 guidance as well.
 The same is true with technical content.  We're adding a lot of capacity this quarter, or growing business.  Again, you've seen that reflected in the CapEx as well as the Q1 technical content line.  And that's also reflected in the guidance as well.
 In terms of state taxes, one thing to keep in mind is we actually collect sales and value-added tax in approximately 50% of our revenue base or a little over 50% of our revenue base today.  So the growth rates that you're seeing reflect the fact that we are collecting in more than half of our revenue base.  So beyond that, there's not a lot I can add there. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     James Mitchell, Goldman Sachs. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
James Mitchell,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Thank you very much for taking the question.  If I look at the 74% growth in North America and other revenues, is that primarily due to Amazon Web Services?
 And then similarly, if I look at the step-up in CapEx, would that also be primarily due to Amazon Web Services?  And then kind of uniting those two questions together, historically, Amazon has been very capital-disciplined.  How do you get confidence that the capital you're putting into Amazon Web Services will generate returns over times that you desire? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP and CFO    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Sure.  If you look at North America other growth, that -- in the North America other includes a number of items including Web services, so it's a combination of all those items that we've talked about in the past.  And so -- but certainly Web services is a meaningful part of that.
 In terms of the CapEx question, what you're seeing in CapEx is, if you look at the growth, we had $1.1 billion of CapEx and -- in the last 12 months.  And if you look at the growth year-over-year of that CapEx, approximately 80% of that is due to pure capacity and that's capacity in terms of fulfillment; it's capacity from an infrastructure standpoint to serve retail business as well as AWS.  And another 10% or 12% is associated with just corporate office space, and the remainder is a number of small items.  So, again, the vast majority, approximately 80%, is due to capacity, both infrastructure and our operations capacity.
 In terms of your question about how we think about AWS, we -- like a lot of parts of our business, we look at that business very discreetly and those services very discreetly.  And we look at the ROIC potential of those businesses and the opportunity to work on trying to figure out the best way to get great returns for shareholders.  And that's something that we've been doing since we launched the business.  And obviously, we have a lot more information to do that now than we did at launch.  But again, it's something that we do continuously.

     Jim Friedland, Cowen and Company. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jim Friedland,  Cowen and Company - Analyst    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     One of the other line items that was up year-over-year was marketing expense, 50 basis points.  Is that a ramp or an incremental ramp in Kindle promotion?  You guys also did something with a LivingSocial promotion in Q1.  And also equity and affiliates was up a little bit.  Was that due to the LivingSocial investment?  Thanks. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP and CFO    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     In terms of marketing, the two primary paid marketing are still our Associates channel and Sponsored Search.  And so those are our two primary.  But you're correct in terms of we are doing, as you've probably seen, some more broadscale advertising related to Kindle, which would be certainly incremental year-over-year and certainly impacting that number.
 In terms of the equity line, we do have a number of equity investments.  And certainly, one of those is LivingSocial and it's certainly impacting that number that you're seeing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ben Schachter,  Macquarie Research - Analyst    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Can you discuss how Amazon views its advertising business?  In particular, how ramping up capabilities there could impact both Amazon properties and devices?
 And then separately, how you participate in advertising opportunities on third-party sites?  Thanks. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP and CFO    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     In terms of our advertising business, it's still very early.  The team has done a fantastic job growing that business, and we'll have to wait and see what we do further with that business.  But it's something that the team has done a great job.  And it allows us -- and we think it allows over time to have another way to have great low prices for customers.

     Colin Sebastian, Lazard Capital Markets. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colin Sebastian,  Lazard Capital Markets - Analyst    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     -- capacity buildouts.  So, when you mentioned at these topline growth rates that you might consider increasing the capital commitment to new capacity, is that something that's already reflected in the Q2 guidance range?  Or is that more likely a decision for the second half of the year?
 And then on the international operating income being down 25%, given that the majority of tech and content spending is incurred in North America, if you could just clarify the drivers of that decline in income.  Thank you. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP and CFO    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     You just -- I'm sorry, Colin, you're just breaking up in the first part of your question around capacity. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colin Sebastian,  Lazard Capital Markets - Analyst    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Sure.  So you mentioned the topline growth.  If these rates continue, you might consider increasing the capital commitment to new capacity.  And so I guess the question is, is that already somewhat reflected in your Q2 guidance?  Or would that be a second half decision in terms of ramping up beyond the nine fulfillment centers? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP and CFO    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Sure.  Well, here's where we are.  We've had announcements of nine fulfillment centers.  One is operational today, one is coming up, will be operational in the coming days.  We're actually doing receiving now.  And then the remainder of those fulfillment centers will be throughout the year.
 And my comment was those are the ones that we've announced, but certainly, with the high growth that we're experiencing, you should expect that should that continue, we would be adding additional fulfillment centers beyond it.  What you are seeing in the Q2 guidance certainly reflects the fact that we will be adding capacity.  And that's certainly one of the factors that went into the guidance that we've given.

Scott Devitt,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Just one question, please.  In categories that are facing structural change in distribution like the book industry, which continues to be your largest segment, I was just wondering if you could talk about the effects that is having today or may have on the margin profile of that business for you over time?  Thanks. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP and CFO    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Well, you know, as we look at these new businesses, we're certainly looking at it from a free cash flow and return on investment standpoint from a long-term -- with a long-term perspective.  We're incredibly excited in the specific one that you mentioned with Kindle, because we see that customers are buying a lot more books.  And so we're incredibly excited to be able to offer that to customers.  We think the potential long-term is -- we love the potential that it has long-term.  And we continue to invest in that business.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Pitz,  UBS - Analyst    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     A couple of quick ones.  For Q2 revenue guidance, would you comment on whether Quidsi and LOVEFiLM are included?  If so, any approximation of the impact?
 And then on content, can you give us any indication on the level of spending to secure digital content rights you anticipate for Prime instant video?  And then any commentary on whether or not that's driving Prime usage.  Thanks. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP and CFO    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     In terms of Quidsi and LOVEFiLM, yes, they're both in Q2.  The impact is on revenue approximately $140 million of revenue in Q2, which works out to be about 220 basis points of growth.  Consolidated segment operating income is actually negative -- approximately $15 million in GAAP operating income is approximately negative $30 million in the quarter.  So that's what's included in the Q2 guidance for Quidsi and LOVEFiLM combined.
 In terms of content, you'll have to stay tuned on that.  We're not splitting out those details, but the only thing I would say about it is we're very, very pleased with the adoption so far.  And it's very early.  We will be adding some more content over time.

Sandeep Aggarwal,  Caris & Company - Analyst    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Thanks for taking my question.  I have two questions.  One is -- Tom, fulfillment and shipping experience have been among the core of (inaudible) Amazon.  And many multi-channel retailers and pure play commerce companies are getting into that space, or getting better at least, including eBay's possible acquisition of GSI Commerce.  So how does Amazon continue to strengthen its competitive modes around fulfillment and shipping experience?
 And second question is, can you make a comment about the capacity utilization of the 13 fulfillment centers you set up last year? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP and CFO    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Sure.  In terms of the first part, we have a fantastic operations team that is continuing to look at ways to improve delivery speed as well as improving our cost structure over time.  And that's something that you've seen if you look back over our history, it's something that they've worked on.  And so they're always looking at ways to better serve customer and to get better.  And so there's a number of ways that they do that and it's a constant focus.
 In terms of the capacity, I don't think there's anything -- any way to really help you, because again, the utilization will vary from week to week and quarter to quarter.  But what we are seeing is, as you'd expect with this great growth that we're experiencing, there is just more demand for capacity.  And that's both from a fulfillment capacity -- that's both from our core retail business as well as fulfilled by Amazon.

     So, for the days payable to vendors, the increase was 11% to 66 days.  How much more improvement do you think that you have there?  Or is there something also driving that improvement that you can share?  Thanks.

     We're not giving -- we have been able to get good improvements over the past several years in AP days.  We're not giving guidance on what that could look like and we continue -- but we continue to work with our partners to improve our working capital cycle.  And obviously, there is certainly a mix of categories that we have.  They all have their own operating cycle.  But, again, we're very pleased with the operating cycle that we have and we'll continue to work with our partners over time.

     Can you just go into a little bit more detail on the DC centers?  So, of the nine centers that you've announced, how many are international?  Then are the costs higher to launch an international DC internationally than in the US?  So just a little more color on that.  Thanks. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP and CFO    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Sure.  Of the nine -- and we could probably have Rob or John get back to you on the exact details -- but approximately four of those are in the US or five in North America, and the others are international.  So -- but the fulfillment centers vary, depend upon level of automation and the location they're in.  I can't really give you a precise "is geography higher than another?"; it kind of depends on size and the level of automation. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rob Eldridge,  Amazon.com, Inc. - VP of IR    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Jason, it's Rob.  I think one thing to add here is Tom's point.  We're expanding fulfillment capacity worldwide; it's not just in a specific geography, because the growth we're seeing is broad-based.
 The second point I guess I just want to make is, as we are building to this level of scale, fulfillment becomes more of a continuous investment project.  It becomes less project-oriented and just something that we need to undertake kind of on a go-forward basis.  And so you're certainly seeing that decision being reflected in our Q1 results and it's also reflected in our Q2 guidance.

Gene Munster,  Piper Jaffray - Analyst    [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     I realize you guys talked about the impact of the LivingSocial promo.  And as we look at the uptick in marketing expenses, it seems that you're spending a little bit more to get each incremental new customer.  Is that true?  And if so, what would be driving that? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP and CFO    [45]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     I'm sorry, I didn't catch the first part of it, the LivingSocial piece. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gene Munster,  Piper Jaffray - Analyst    [46]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     I know you mentioned the LivingSocial, the impact of the LivingSocial promo on the marketing expenses.  But backing that out, as you look at your marketing expenses, can you just talk a little bit about customer acquisition costs and how they've been trending? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP and CFO    [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     In terms of -- I didn't mention anything about LivingSocial as it related to our marketing expense line.  What I was referring to is, if you look at our equity income line on our income statement, you can see in expense there.  And I said that that was made up of a number of different investments that we have, which includes LivingSocial.  So that was the LivingSocial piece.
 In terms of marketing spend, we still -- the spend is very efficient.  And again, what I mentioned earlier was that still the two primary pieces of our spend are our Associates channel and also Sponsored Search.  And so those are our two primary.  In terms of looking at it year-over-year, you're also seeing some of the broadscale spending we're doing, specifically related to Kindle on impacting that number as well.

     Seeing growth rates accelerate even slightly for the first time in the past four quarters, to what extent would you attribute that to the infrastructure buildout, improving product selection and availability?  And maybe to get a little more granular -- can you quantify for us the improvement in your product delivery time or availability that you've seen since beginning this investment cycle? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP and CFO    [50]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     In terms of quantifying, I'm not sure how much I can help you with that, but there's no question that what we're seeing is customers responding to the increased selection across many categories, across many geographies.  We're also -- certainly, Prime is having an impact as well as our other free shipping offers.  And so the adoption of both has been great.  And so we're very pleased to do that.
 Also, making sure that we have great, low prices for customers is also having an impact.  All of those things with -- are having an impact on our growth rate that you see there.

     Thanks for taking my question.  So, I sort of have noticed that the growth in units relative to growth in revenue is a pretty substantial difference and kind of a widening difference.  I was wondering if you could explain -- when a customer becomes a digital customer and they start buying, whether it Kindle books or another digital product, how does their spending on Amazon change?  Are they spending similar amounts with you and just buying more units?  Or is the actual amount of spending with Amazon going up?  Because obviously, the unit growth is a lot.  Thanks. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP and CFO    [53]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     I apologize, Steve, but there's not a lot I'll be able to help you with there in terms of specific numbers.  But we are seeing customers who are digital customers still being very good physical customers as well.  So buying -- doing a lot of cross-shopping across our business.
 And so we're very excited about our digital offerings and it's certainly reflected in the unit growth that you mentioned.  But also we're seeing very good growth amongst many physical categories across all of our geographies as well.  So, again, customers are responding to some of the things I already mentioned, but they're certainly responding to the selection that we have for our digital offerings as well as our physical product offerings.  And that's reflected in the growth rate.

     And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one final question tonight.  It does come from Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt Nemer,  Wells Fargo Securities - Analyst    [55]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Thanks for taking my question -- two questions, actually.  One, is there a point where increased digital offering sales offset investments in selection and in-stocks, and we start to see that in the inventory turns number?
 And then, secondly, a question on fulfillment and tax issues.  How flexible is your fulfillment capacity in the US if a state changes its mind or reneges on a prior agreement regarding tax collection?  Thanks. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP and CFO    [56]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     In terms of your first question, the reason why we're adding the physical capacity is it's growing very fast.  So we are having the benefit of seeing both a very strong growth in our digital offerings as well as a very strong growth in our physical offering.  So it's the combination of those things that are driving the overall growth of our business as well as the fulfillment centers that you're seeing, in the case of your question.
 In terms of the fulfillment centers, we have a lot of -- we have a wide range of fulfillment centers across a number of different states and geographies.  And we continue -- our operations team does a great job in terms of figuring out where the best places are to invest.  And they'll continue to do that over time.
