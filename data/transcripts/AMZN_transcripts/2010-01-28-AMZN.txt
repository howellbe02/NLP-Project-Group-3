Presentation
Operator    [1]

           Good day, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 financial results conference.  Today's call is being recorded.  For today's opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr.  Rob Eldridge.  Please go ahead, sir. 

Rob Eldridge,  Amazon.com, Inc. - VP IR    [2]

           Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2009 financial results conference call.  Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO.  He and I will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.
 The following discussion and response to your questions reflects management's views as of today, January 28, 2010, only, and will include forward-looking statements.  Actual results may differ materially.  Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K.
 As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.  During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures.  In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
 Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2008.  Now I will turn the call over Tom. 

Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP, CFO    [3]

           Thanks, Rob.  I'll begin with comments on our fourth-quarter financial results.  Trailing 12-month free cash flow grew 114% to $2.92 billion.  Return on invested capital was 66%, up from 41%.  ROIC is TT and free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter-ends.
 The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 461 million shares, compared with 446 million shares.  Worldwide revenue grew 42% to $9.52 billion, or 37%, excluding the $354 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates.
 We are grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection, and free shipping offers, including Amazon Prime.
 Media revenue increased to $4.68 billion, up 29%, or 23% excluding foreign exchange rates.  EGM revenue increased to $4.61 billion, up 60%, or 54% excluding foreign exchange rates.  Worldwide, EGM increased to 48% of worldwide sales, up from 43%.
 Worldwide unit growth was 37%.  Active customer accounts exceeded 105 million, up 19%.  Worldwide active-seller accounts were more than 1.9 million, up 24%.  Seller units were 28% of total units.
 Worldwide gross profit was $1.98 billion, up 47%.
 Now I will discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation.  Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content, and G&A combined was $1.3 billion, or 14.5% of sales, down 25 basis points year over year.
 Fulfillment was $733 million, or 7.7% of revenue, compared with 7.9%.  Tech and content was $297 million, or 3.1% of revenue, compared with 3.5%.  Marketing was $269 million, or 2.8% of revenue, up from 2.5% in the prior year.
 Now I will talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line items.
 In the North America segment, revenue grew 36% to $4.96 billion.  Zappos, which is included in our results beginning November 1, 2009, contributed approximately $200 million to our fourth-quarter revenue.
 Media revenue grew 20% to $2.1 billion.  EGM revenue grew 54% to $2.66 billion, representing 54% of North America revenues, up from 48%.  North America gross profit grew 50% to $1.17 billion, and gross margin increased 211 basis points to 23.6%, driven by increases in other revenue; improvements in inventory management, including vendor pricing; and increases in 3P product sales; partially offset by lower prices for our customers and changes in product mix.
 North America segment operating income increased 113% to $278 million, or 5.6% operating margin.
 In the international segment, revenue grew 49% to $4.56 billion.  Revenue growth was 37%, adjusting for the $344 million year-over-year favorable impact from foreign exchange rates during the quarter.
 Media revenue grew 37% to $2.58 billion, or 26% excluding FX.  In EGM, revenue grew 68% to $1.95 billion, or 56% excluding FX.  EGM now represents 43% of international revenues, up from 38%.
 International gross profit grew 42% to $806 million, or grew 31% excluding FX, while gross margin decreased 79 basis points to 17.7%, driven by lower prices for our customers and changes in product mix, partially offset by improvements in inventory management, including vendor pricing and the increases in 3P product sales.
 International segment operating income increased 39% to $319 million, a 7% operating margin.  Excluding the favorable impact on foreign exchange rates, international segment operating income increased 25%.
 Consolidated segment operating income grew 66% to $597 million, or 6.3% of revenue, up 91 basis points year over year.  Excluding the $31 million favorable impact of foreign-exchange rates, CSOI grew 58%.
 Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense.  GAAP operating income grew 75% to $476 million, or 5% of net sales.
 Our income tax expense was $85 million in Q4, or an 18% rate for the quarter.  GAAP net income was $384 million, or $0.85 per diluted share, compared with $225 million and $0.52 per diluted share.
 Now I will discuss the full-year results.  Revenue grew 28% to $24.51 billion, or 29%, excluding the $182 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates.  North America revenue grew 25% to $12.83 billion, and international grew 31% to $11.68 billion, or 33% growth excluding year-over-year changes in FX.
 Consolidated segment operating income, or CSOI, grew 44% to $1.57 billion, or 48%, excluding $40 million of unfavorable year-over-year impact from foreign-exchange rates, and operating margin increased 71 basis points to 6.4%.  GAAP operating income grew 34% to $1.13 billion, or 4.6% of net sales.
 Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $2.64 billion year over year to $6.37 billion.  Our cash and marketable securities primarily consist of cash, government and government agency securities, AAA-rated money market funds, and other investment grade securities.  Such amounts are recorded at fair value.
 In January 2010, our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $2 billion of our common stock, replacing our previous share repurchase program.
 Inventory increased 55% to $2.17 billion and inventory turns were 12.2, unchanged from a year ago, even as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels, and introduced new product categories.
 Accounts payable increased 56% to $5.61 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 68 days from 62 days in the prior year.
 Our 2009 capital expenditures were $373 million.  While we are not providing CapEx guidance on today's call, we want to remind you that we are beginning the transition to our new Seattle offices this year.  We will incur incremental CapEx of approximately $100 million in 2010 in support of this multiyear project.
 I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance.  Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be an appropriately conservative assumptions.  Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange-rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending.  It is not possible to accurately predict demand and, therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
 As we describe in more detail and our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to our effective tax rates can all have material effect on guidance.  Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that the foreign-exchange rates remain approximately where they been recently.
 We are prospectively adopting accounting standard update number 2009-13, revenue recognition, multiple delivery revenue arrangements, as of January 1, 2010.  Sales of our Kindle e-reader are considered arrangements with multiple elements, which include the device, wireless connectivity, and software upgrades.  The revenue related to the device, which is a substantial portion of the total sales price and related costs, will be recognized at the time of delivery.
 Revenue for the wireless connectivity and the software upgrades will be continued to be amortized over the life of the device, which remains estimated at two years.  The impact of the adoption of this standard is included in the first-quarter 2010 guidance.
 For Q1, we expect net sales of between $6.45 billion and $7 billion, or growth of between 32% and 43%.  This guidance anticipates approximately 500 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange.
 GAAP operating income to be between $275 million and $365 million, or grow between 13% and 50%.  This includes approximately $110 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.  We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $385 million and $475 million, or growth of between 20% and 48%.
 We remain heads-down focused on driving better customer experience through price, selection, and convenience.  We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.
 Thanks, and with that, Rob, let's move to questions.



Questions and Answers
Operator    [1]

     (Operator Instructions).  Mark Mahaney, Citigroup. 

Mark Mahaney,  Citigroup - Analyst    [2]

     A quick question.  Is that tax rate of 18%, should we extrapolate from that going forward?
 Secondly, any broad comment on your ability to sell, increasingly sell, consumer staples, particularly momentum behind that Subscribe & Save program?
 And then, finally, could you help us quantify at all the Kindle impact -- the difference in accounting, maybe by providing an adjustment for what Kindle revenue or something would've been like last year?  Some way for us to parse out how much of an increase in the -- how much of the guidance could just be due to a change in the revenue recognition?  Thanks a lot. 

Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP, CFO    [3]

     In terms of the tax rate, it was 18% for the quarter, 22% for the year.  That includes, certainly, the reason why the change in Q4 is related to the jurisdictions that we operate in.  Again, we're not providing guidance beyond 2009 for taxes.
 In terms of consumer staples, it's certainly a category that we like.  It's growing very nicely.  Subscribe & Save, from an adoption standpoint, is working, and so those are the things that we're going to continue to focus on, as well as other things to try to grow that particular category.
 As it relates to the Kindle change, we have provided some information in the 10-K.  Essentially, the way you should think about guidance is -- certainly the change is effective 1-1, so it's included in our Q1 guidance, so for the units that we sell, a substantial portion of the price times those units will be reflected in our revenue.
 In addition to that, we have approximately $500 million of deferred revenue from shipments from last year that will be amortized between 2010 and 2011.  So, a portion of that $500 million will also be in Q1. 

Operator    [4]

     James Mitchell, Goldman Sachs. 

James Mitchell,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [5]

     Great.  Just to follow up on the previous question, you mentioned that a portion of the $500 million deferred revenue will be booked in Q1.  Could you just run through that, because I assumed that it would be a retroactive restatement to previous quarters?
 Then also, when you look at the Zappos benefit to 1Q 2010 revenue, is it fair to assume it's similar to 4Q 2009's $200 million, given on the one hand you have a full three months of the quarter, but on the other hand it's a seasonally slower quarter?  Thank you. 

Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP, CFO    [6]

     Yes, in terms of the change, we are adopting it actually prospectively, so as of 1-1, we are not restating, so, again, that's -- so it's reflected in our Q1 guidance.
 In terms of -- your other question was in terms of Zappos, how to think about it.  I think probably the best way to do it would be -- again, we're not giving guidance on Zappos specifically.  It's reflected in the guidance that we gave for Q1.
 We have released the -- certainly the previous quarter, so you can go back to Q1 of last year, make your own assumptions in terms of growth rate for a year-over-year, and certainly there would be a range there, but you can see that's probably the best way to think about it and look at what you'd put in for Q1. 

Operator    [7]

     Imran Khan, JPMorgan. 

Imran Khan,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [8]

     One housekeeping and one more of a big-picture question.  Housekeeping, North American gross margins improved 200 basis points on a year-over-year basis.  Trying to understand what are some moving parts that help in driving these gross margins higher and how should we think about the swing factors in the North American gross margins.
 And secondly, as we look at the media business becoming more digital, and we see more and more new devices coming to the marketplace, could you help us understand how does Amazon's competitive advantage or competitive position change in the marketplace?  I.e., obviously physical versus web, you have some competitive advantage, but if there are a lot of more devices have sold that can download books electronically, how does your competitive advantage or how does your competitive position change? 

Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP, CFO    [9]

     In terms of your first question, North America gross margins were up a little over 200 basis points, as you mentioned.  Number of drivers, certainly we had a nice increase in other revenue, which includes our web services business, our service business, as well as other agreements that go into that line item.
 Inventory management, we are getting better at inventory management, which also flows into our operating results as well.  We're getting better prices from suppliers and partners.  We had good third-party sales.  So those are the key contributors.
 Partially offsetting that, we certainly had lower prices during the quarter.  So that -- those are really the drivers for gross margin.
 In terms of how we are thinking about the digital and physical within media, we think we're positioned very nicely from a digital perspective.  We have, obviously, some longer-standing relationships with many, many different partners around the world in those particular categories.
 We think we are focused on the customer, and I think when you look at Kindle, that's a -- certainly a good example of that.  We think we built a nice -- very nice purpose book -- purpose device, and that's -- excuse me, that's purpose built for reading.  And we believe that readers deserve to have a dedicated device with great selection at great prices.
 So those are the things that we've worked on in the 27 months since launch, and those are the things that we'll continue to focus on, again starting with the customer. 

Operator    [10]

     Jeetil Patel, Deutsche Bank. 

Jeetil Patel,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [11]

     Two questions.  First of all, you've been in prime international -- in the international markets for a little over two years now, and I guess if we go back domestically, saw a nice little acceleration in unit growth when you hit the two-year mark.  Is it safe to assume that you're seeing a similar trend internationally, given the growth internationally plus the unit growth acceleration?
 Second question, you've got a lot of different services you've worked on over the years, between Kindle, digital music, digital video, cloud computing, and Web services.  Is there any sort of, I guess, perspective or view that you have that maybe there is an opportunity to consolidate or integrate all these services together in a unified platform that can be licensed or OEMed to other companies to utilize, while you kind of manage the backbone behind it? 

Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP, CFO    [12]

     In terms of your first question, Prime, we are very pleased with the performance of Prime in each of the geographies, and it's certainly contributing to our international growth, as well as the North -- continues to help our North America growth as well.
 And so, and other factors that are also helping international are, certainly, we've added a number of categories.  Along with those categories, obviously, comes a lot of selection.  We have continued to improve our in-stock levels.
 Prime, as you mentioned, is helping, and just making sure we have great prices.  And so, getting products to customers fast is important, and Prime is one of the ways that helps us do that.
 In terms of your second question, I'm not sure there's a lot I can help you with there.  In each of those services, our primary focus is how do we have a great customer experience?  And that's the one thing that's common in all of those, and we're going to continue to focus, as we have in our physical business, on how do we make sure that we have great experience, and those are the things that are in common. 

Jeetil Patel,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [13]

     You think all those individual services can be offered up as a kind of bundled solution ever?  (multiple speakers) 

Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP, CFO    [14]

     You know, I hate to speculate on something like that.  I think it's -- we are focused on what's right for customers, and many of those have distinct customer sets that are different from each other.  Again, we are focused on how to make that experience great. 

Operator    [15]

     Justin Post, BofA Merrill Lynch. 

Justin Post,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [16]

     Yes, two questions.  First, when you look at the deferred revenues on the cash flow statement, I think you recognized 444.  You had that much in deferred revenues this year in the fourth quarter versus 162.  My first question, is there anything materially different, besides Kindle, in those two numbers?
 Second thing.  When you say you have millions of Kindle users, is it safe to assume that you have over 2 million now, at least?
 And then, finally, when you think about the category rollout roadmap, can you give us any thoughts on where you are on that?  Are you 80% of all the categories you can roll out or are there still a lot more opportunity?  How would you find that opportunity at this point in your lifecycle?  Thank you. 

Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP, CFO    [17]

     Sure.  In terms of deferred revenue, there's a number of things that go in to deferred revenue.  Certainly Kindle has been one of those and will have some there for some time as we roll that off.  The other is certainly Prime, as well as a few others.  But those are certainly two of the bigger items, and we're not breaking those out.
 In terms of category roll out, hard to say in percentage terms, but we have still a lot of room to add additional selections.  If you look at it on a worldwide basis, think about it this way.  We have many new geographies that we can enter, some of which -- many that we support today from an export standpoint.
 But we could certainly roll out more geographies so we can add category selection there, and we can add many new categories in all of our geographies.  And then, also, we are adding selection in categories that we've been in for 10 or more years each year.  We continue to grow the selection of those categories.
 So, it is one of the inputs to growth.  It's one that we're very focused on.  It's one we're going to be continued to be focused on for many years to come because there's just a lot of selection to add out there.
 And then, there was -- I think there was a third part.  I apologize.  I missed it. 

Justin Post,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [18]

     Is it Kindle users is at least 2 million, or can you give us any thoughts on that? 

Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP, CFO    [19]

     Again, other than the quote, I can't really add much to that. 

Operator    [20]

     Doug Anmuth, Barclays Capital. 

Doug Anmuth,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [21]

     Tom, can you talk about your thoughts on potentially opening up to the e-pub reader standard for the Kindle, and then also provide some color on why you have separated the Kindle device team from the Kindle media team internally?  Thanks. 

Rob Eldridge,  Amazon.com, Inc. - VP IR    [22]

     Doug, it's Rob here.  How are you doing?  In terms of e-pub, our platform here is designed that -- to have a seamless experience across multiple [sub] devices with Whispersync.  And we think that's the right customer experience for us to continue to deliver in the future.  And your second question? 

Doug Anmuth,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [23]

     Separating out the Kindle device team from the Kindle media team internally.  (Multiple speakers) 

Rob Eldridge,  Amazon.com, Inc. - VP IR    [24]

     You know, again, we have a -- we're not commenting on how we are organized.  We have a great team across many geographies figuring out the best way to serve customers, and beyond that, I can't comment. 

Operator    [25]

     Scott Devitt, Morgan Stanley. 

Scott Devitt,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [26]

     I have two, please.  The first one was just related to the emergence of new hardware in the digital book business, and also the emergence of potentially higher price points and how you think that your relationship with publishers potentially could evolve over time in terms of impacting the $9.99 price point.
 And then, secondly, and again just qualitatively, because I know you won't answer this one directly, but 3P mix, U.S.  versus international.  Can you give us some gauge in terms of the differences and distinctions in those areas?  Thank you. 

Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP, CFO    [27]

     In terms of 3P, we're pleased with both segments.  We continue to grow nicely in our seller business and we continue to look for ways to improve that experience, not only for our customers but for sellers, which is certainly another customer set that we have.
 And one example of that is fulfill by Amazon, which has certainly been helpful in terms of growing our selection from sellers and the number of sellers, as well.
 In terms of discussions about any of the other relationships with vendors, and this would be any category, not just the one that you mentioned, certainly those -- any of those discussions that we would have would be between us and those particular partners.  But the main focus of those discussions would always be, for us, how do we make sure we can offer customers the selection that they want at great low prices.
 So those are the things that are always continuous -- we're always continually focused on in each of our categories, in each of our geographies. 

Operator    [28]

     Sandeep Aggarwal, Collins Stewart. 

Sandeep Aggarwal,  Collins Stewart - Analyst    [29]

     Tom, can you talk about the international penetration of Kindle?  I know you don't talk about the units or absolute number, but maybe in terms of number of countries where the Kindle is now available internationally, perhaps the ratio of U.S.  versus non-U.S.  units sold, or maybe the growth trajectory your first three months of Kindles sold in U.S.  versus international. 

Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP, CFO    [30]

     Sure, it's -- obviously, we're not providing a lot of data.  It's available in over 130 countries today.
 We think it's a great opportunity for customers as well as us, long term, and we are continually trying to figure out ways in those geographies to make that experience even better than it is today.  So I apologize, I can't add any more detail to that. 

Operator    [31]

     Ben Schachter, Broadpoint AmTech. 

Ben Schachter,  Broadpoint AmTech - Analyst    [32]

     I just want to go back to the U.S.  gross margin question, and if I recall last year, you talked a lot about the macro situation leading to better pricing from vendors, and this year it sounds like you also got better pricing from vendors.  So, any qualitative remarks on sort of what's driving your ability to get the better vendor pricing?  Is it truly volume, or are there other things there?
 Then just quickly, any comments on the Amazon branded products?  Any update there?  Thanks. 

Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP, CFO    [33]

     It is a -- certainly, the biggest factor would be volume.  And -- but it's in a few different pieces.  One is you can take a look at our overall growth, which, in the case of North America, was up 36%.  That was certainly helped by Zappos as part of that.
 If you take out Zappos to the number that I gave you, it would be about 31% growth, which is still a nice acceleration from where we've been recently.  So, that's one -- just overall volume.
 The other is, when you look at North America, some of the categories that we are in, that we just started a few years ago, are becoming more and more meaningful.  And so as those become more and more meaningful, good things happen.  We're able to get better prices from suppliers.
 But also, they become more attractive for third-party sellers to sell on our detail pages.  So it's a combination of those items that allow us to grow -- allowed us to grow gross margins in Q4, while lowering prices for customers.  So, it was the combination of those factors. 

Operator    [34]

     Youssef Squali, Jefferies & Company. 

Youssef Squali,  Jefferies & Company - Analyst    [35]

     Two quick questions first.  In the press release, it said something to the effect that -- for -- that you sell six Kindle books for every 10 physical books.  Can you give us that number a year ago, just so that we can have something to compare it to?
 And second, I guess I'd like to ask the inverse of Doug's question with regards to Apple and the operating system.  Will Apple continue to support the Kindle app with their iPad? 

Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP, CFO    [36]

     The answer to your second question is yes.  And the answer to your first question is, I apologize, I can't give you that.  But again, the -- so far this year, six -- is that right?  -- six of 10 was digital versus physical where we have both editions. 

Operator    [37]

     Colin Sebastian, Lazard Capital Markets. 

Colin Sebastian,  Lazard Capital Markets - Analyst    [38]

     I guess, firstly, I wanted to ask you about your pricing strategy, if there's been any change there with regards to being a price follower or a price leader.
 And then, secondly, looking at the Q1 outlook, if you can talk about some of the variables that might lead to a year-over-year contraction in the CSOI margin?  If that's Zappos related, perhaps, or from the deferred revenues from Kindle, or something else?  Thank you. 

Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP, CFO    [39]

     Sure.  In terms of pricing, no, nothing has changed.  We're all about -- I would make sure we have great prices across all of our categories, across all of our geographies, so nothing has changed there.
 In terms of Q1, we've given a range that we think is appropriate, and as you can see from the lower end of the range, it's as you described.  For the upper range, you see operating margins improving year over year, and again, we are very positive about what we saw in Q4, as well as what we saw as we progressed throughout 2009.
 Yet, there is still a degree of certain uncertainty out there.  So we think that's representative of the guidance that we've given and we think it's appropriate.
 In terms of your other question, in terms of individual breakouts of businesses, we're not providing that as part of our guidance. 

Operator    [40]

     Thank you.  That concludes the question-and-answer session.  Mr.  Eldridge, I'll turn the conference back over to you. 

Rob Eldridge,  Amazon.com, Inc. - VP IR    [41]

     Great.  Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions.  A replay will be available on the investor relations website at least through the end of the quarter.
 We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter. 

Operator    [42]

     This concludes today's conference.  Thank you for your participation.
