Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

           Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com first-quarter 2010 financial results conference call.  As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.  At this time I would like to turn the call over to Mr.  Rob Eldridge.  Please go ahead, sir. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rob Eldridge,  Amazon.com, Inc. - VP, IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

           Hello and welcome to our Q1 2010 financial results conference call.  Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO.  We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.  The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 22, 2010 only and will include forward-looking statements.  Actual results may differ materially.  Additional information about the factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K.
 As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.
 During this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures.  In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
 Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2009.  Now I will turn the call over to Tom. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP & CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

           Thanks, Rob.  I will begin with comments on our financial results.  Trailing 12-month free cash flow grew 62% to $2.32 billion.  Return on invested capital is 45%, up from 41%.  ROIC is TT and free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter-ends.  The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 463 million shares compared with 447 million.  Worldwide revenue grew 46% to $7.13 billion or 42%, excluding the $185 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates.
 We are grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and free shipping offers, including Amazon Prime.
 Media revenue increased $3.43 billion, up 26% or 22% excluding foreign exchange rates.  EGM revenue increased to $3.51 billion, up 72% or 68% excluding FX.  Worldwide EGM increased to 49% of worldwide sales, up from 42%.  Worldwide unit growth was 40%.  Active customer accounts exceeded $114 million.  For the first time, this number includes our Amazon China customer accounts.  Worldwide active seller accounts were approximately $2 million, up 22%.  Sales units were 31% of total units.
 Consolidated gross profit grew 42% to $1.63 billion, and gross margin decreased 62 basis points to 22.9%.  We no longer present gross profit in our consolidated statement of operations as we believe income from operations is a more meaningful measure due to the diversity of our product categories and services.  Our focus is on growing operating profit dollars rather than maximizing percentages.
 Now I will discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation.  Fulfillment, marketing, technical content and G&A combined was $1.12 billion or 15.8% of sales, down 115 basis points year-over-year.  Fulfillment was $528 million or 7.4% of revenue compared with 8.3%.  Technical content was $319 million or 4.5% of revenue compared with 4.9%.  Marketing was $196 million or 2.7% of revenue, up from 2.5% in the prior year.
 Now I will talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments or stock-based compensation or other operating expense line items.
 In the North America segment, revenue grew 47% to $3.78 billion.  Media revenue grew 22% to $1.6 billion.  EGM revenue grew 73% to $2.02 billion, representing 54% of North America's revenues, up from 45%.  North America segment operating income increased 81% to $273 million, a 7.2% operating margin.
 In the international segment, revenue grew 45% to $3.35 billion.  Revenue growth was 37%, adjusting for the $175 million year-over-year favorable FX impact during the quarter.  Media revenue grew 29% to $1.83 billion or 23%, excluding FX.  In EGM revenue grew 70% to $1.49 billion or 61%, excluding FX.  EGM now represents 44% of international revenues, up from 38%.
 International segment operating income increased 37% to $234 million, a 7% operating margin.  Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange rates, international segment operating income increased 26%.  CSOI grew 58% to $507 million or 7.1% of revenue, up 53 basis points year-over-year.  Excluding the $15 million favorable impact from foreign exchange rates, CSOI grew 53%.
 Unlike CSOI our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense.  GAAP operating income grew 62% to $394 million or 5.5% of net sales.  Our income tax expense was $100 million in Q1 or a 25% rate for the quarter.  GAAP net income was $299 million or $0.66 per diluted share compared with $177 million and $0.41 per diluted share.
 Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $2.33 billion year over year to $5.06 billion.  Inventory increased 44% to $1.82 billion, and inventory turns were 12.6, up from 12.5 turns a year ago, even as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels, and introduced new product categories.
 Accounts Payable increased 52% to $3.62 billion, and Accounts Payable days increased to 59 from 57 in the prior year.
 Our Q1 2010 capital expenditures were $140 million.  The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services; additional investments in support of continued business growth, including capacity to support fulfillment operations; and investments in corporate office space, which we expect to continue throughout 2010.
 I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance.  Incorporated into the guidance are the order trends that we have seen to date in what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions.  Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by as many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending.
 It is not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
 As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intracompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to our effective tax rates, can all have a material effect on guidance.  Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.
 For Q2 we expect net sales of between $6.1 billion and $6.7 billion or growth of between 31% and 44%.  This anticipates approximately 100 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange.  Cap operating income to be between $220 million and $320 million or to grow between 39% and 102%.  The second-quarter 2009 results include the impact of our settlement with Toys "R" Us for $51 million, substantially all of which was expensed during the quarter.  This includes approximately $130 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.  We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expenses, to be between $350 million and $450 million, a growth of between 15% and 48%.
 We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience.  We believe that putting the customer first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.
 Thanks and with that, Rob, let's move to questions.

           Great.  Thanks, Tom.  Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call.  Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?

Questions and Answers

     (Operator Instructions).  Colin Sebastian, Lazard Capital Markets. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colin Sebastian,  Lazard Capital Markets - Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Congratulations on a very strong quarter.  I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about the same day delivery program, how that is playing out in cities where it is offered, and is this something that could be rolled out more broadly if successful in testing in the existing markets? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP & CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Sure.  Probably the best way to describe it is similar to other programs that we have related to fast shipping, meaning Prime.  We are finding that customers like it.  We certainly think that customers like the reliability of getting their products so efficiently so quickly, and it's hard to say what we will do beyond what we're doing today with same day.  But we certainly think that getting a product to customers fast is important. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     James Mitchell, Goldman Sachs. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
James Mitchell,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Actually two questions.  One is, with regards to the very large active customer number, that includes China but not Zappos?  I just wanted to check.  I assumed they would like 5 million each from China and from Zappos if you did include Zappos.
 And then secondly, when I look at the expansion in North American operating margins in the quarter, was that helped by sales of digital media and also Amazon Web Services? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP & CFO    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     I will take the second part first.  The North America expansion was driven by a number of things.  Certainly the very strong growth and then it was also driven by us being able to leverage our overall expenses.  If you take a look at our global fulfillment costs as a percentage of revenue, you can certainly see a lot of leverage there, and that is also true when you look at North America.  We have not added any significant capacity in North America since Q3 of '08.  Certainly with the growth rates that you are seeing, you should expect that we will be adding capacity over time there.  But again, it was driven by a lot of different factors and with a lot of different product categories growing very strong and us being able to leverage those expenses.
 In terms of the first part, could you repeat the first part again?  It was related to -- 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
James Mitchell,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     (multiple speakers) -- from the customers, did that include China and also Zappos or just China, and is it fair to assume that each of China and Zappos would contribute about 5 million active customers? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP & CFO    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Yes, you are correct.  The active customer number does not include Zappos, but it does include China this quarter for the first time.  And we are not at this point breaking out the addition of China at this point.  So it is 114 million active customers worldwide at this point.

Douglas Anmuth,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Just two quick questions.  Can you comment on the headcount?  It looks like it went up by about 1800 people on a sequential basis, certainly a larger number than we would have expected.  And then the second one is just the tax rate being a little bit higher at 25%.  Is that purely just the function of higher North America profit? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP & CFO    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The first part in terms of headcount, the biggest piece of that is related to fulfillment.  Coming out of Q4, we always have certain people additions related to that.  So again, a sizable piece of that incremental headcount was due to operations, and the rest was certainly in areas to help us grow as we move forward.
 In terms of the effective tax, certainly the mix of our geographies is certainly what is making that change, yes.

Youssef Squali,  Jefferies & Co. - Analyst    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Two quick questions for Tom.  First, one of your competitors talks about seeing some weakness in Europe, ex-UK.  Looking at your international margins, it looks like they came a little bit under pressure.  They were down by about 40 or 50 bps year on year.  Is that something you guys saw as well?
 And then by our estimates, the change in accounting for Kindle that you instituted in Q1 resulted again at least by our math in somewhere between $80 million and $100 million of additional revenues for the quarter.  Can you maybe just help us understand if we are in the right ZIP code there? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP & CFO    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The first question, we are not bringing out individual geographies within the international segment.  But what you are seeing in international is very strong growth, and we were pleased across all of our geographies.  Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, we saw growth of 37%, which is certainly very good, and it was driven by a number of things.
 Certainly we have added many new categories and a lot of selections over the past few years.  We certainly have -- we are focused on making sure that we have great competitive low prices, which is certainly fueling growth.  Prime is also a factor, and third-party growth continues to be very strong.  So those are the factors that are driving the international growth.
 In terms of the change in accounting for Kindle, we are not breaking out any precise numbers on that.  But the way you should think about it is maybe a few different items.  One is, if you look at our overall growth rate and you look at it on a local currency basis, we certainly have for the first time a full quarter of Zappos included in those numbers, as well as the change in accounting for Kindle.  And if you back out exchange in those two items and you compare it to the equivalent growth rate in Q4, you did see a few hundred basis points acceleration in growth from Q4 to Q1.  So I cannot give you much more of a breakout than that, but you can see that we did see an acceleration of growth there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Pitz,  UBS - Analyst    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     With your comment on the impetus to begin selling the Kindle through brick-and-mortar stores, then do you expect to make the device more widely available?  Also, I'm just curious why the rollout is limited to so few stores. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP & CFO    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Well, it is starting with a small number of stores.  But we are very pleased to be working with Target, and we think we are very pleased to have even more customers see Kindle and have the opportunity to purchase Kindle.  So that is why we are doing it, and we are very excited to do it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Mahaney,  Citi - Analyst    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     I know why you may not want to talk so much about gross margins.  I understand you're running the business for operating profits and then cash flow.  But could you provide a little bit more color on the gross margin trends, particularly in international markets, given what should be some pretty positive mix shifts and scale factors, but mix shifts towards the digital goods and AWS and things like that.  The trends seem a little surprising.  Anything in terms of vendor terms, product mixes that may have explained the gross margin trends. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP & CFO    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     In terms of international -- it was primarily driven by certainly a number of factors.  We continue to have lower prices and make sure that we have great competitive prices obviously in a challenging environment, which includes free shipping offers and Amazon Prime included in that.  And, keep in mind, that we have launched many new categories over the past few years.  So, as we have talked about in the past, it takes some time to get the scale in those categories, and we are seeing very broad growth across many categories, including the new categories.  And so certainly that mix is having an impact, and all those factors are being partially offset by a very strong solid third-party growth, as well as the savings that we will get from our vendor partners.  So again, those are the key drivers. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Mahaney,  Citi - Analyst    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     And one quick follow-up on marketing for the Kindle, is there any change in your thinking of the level of marketing support you will provide given obviously a much more competitive environment? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP & CFO    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Well, you know, in terms of marketing itself, you saw that it increased a little bit as a percentage of revenue year over year.  We are doing advertising for Kindle.  It is certainly a product in an area that we are very excited about.  You have probably seen some of the ads that we are doing, as well as doing online marketing. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Scott Devitt, Morgan Stanley. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scott Devitt,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The first-quarter operating margin was 7.1%, and at the midpoint of revenue and operating margin on a cash basis in 2Q, I think it is 6.3%.  So, Tom, could you just talk through what the factors are that would drive operating margin down sequentially that order of magnitude?
 And then secondly, stock-based compensation I think you guided to $110 million and did $87 million and then guided to $130 million in 2Q.  So what is the volatility in that line item in the first quarter and going forward? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP & CFO    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Sure.  I will take the second part first.  The $87 million is actually the equivalent of stock-based compensation amortization of intangibles, which is $113 million.  And so it has gone from $113 million to $130 million.
 In terms of the operating margin, we are not giving operating margin guidance for Q2.  But the implied operating margin we do have a -- consistent with what we have done in prior periods, we have a range of operating income, and that range is $350 million to $450 million.  At the lower end of the range, it is 5.7% of implied operating margin and 6.7% on the high end.  On the high end, you would see an expansion of operating margins of approximately 20 basis points year-over-year.  And so that's the guidance based on what we see by looking at all the factors.  And so there's not much I can help you with that.
 I would -- one thing to keep in mind, though, as I mentioned in one of the earlier questions, with growth we are experiencing, we need to make sure we support that growth.  And what that means is we will continue to add capacity in our various businesses to support that growth, whether it be our retail business, our AWS business, or our third-party seller business, including [FPA].  So those are things that we certainly are supporting given the growth that we are having.
 The other thing is we will continue as we have in prior years.  We still think there is a lot of opportunity in front of us.  And so, as we have in prior years, we will make sure that we are judicious about where we make those additions, but we will add resources to make sure that we capitalize on those growth opportunities.  So those are the things that we are thinking about.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jeetil Patel,  Deutsche Bank Securities - Analyst    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Two questions.  I guess the unit growth nicely accelerated from the fourth-quarter levels, and the trend line you have been seeing historically, I guess can you talk about whether that is more of a function of the domestic business and still seeing very good purchase frequency or international now participating as Prime has now been out there for well north of two years?
 And then second just broader question, but in a world where we are going towards mobile and smartphones from an immediate consumption standpoint, can you, I guess, talk about what is the opportunity from an e-commerce standpoint?  Do you think that it will be just as good of an e-commerce-oriented environment on a mobile device as you see in an desktop Internet world since it is a smaller form factor, smaller screen?  How do you have to change if you have to in terms of how you present information to consumers? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP & CFO    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     I will take the second part of your question first.  We are excited about the idea that the world may shift to a place where 3G connected devices are available to browse the net.  And our view is that the more Web connected devices whether it be tablets or smartphones, the better that it is for our retail business as you are suggesting.  We will figure out the best way to make sure that we make it as easy as possible for our customers to purchase from those devices.  But we think that it is an exciting opportunity to have a world that looks like that.
 In terms of your unit question, as you can probably expect, given the growth we are seeing both in North America and in international from a revenue perspective, we are seeing very good growth in units as well.  And so we are very pleased with the unit growth we are seeing in both segments. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jeetil Patel,  Deutsche Bank Securities - Analyst    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     I guess does that I guess on the former question that I asked about how mobile changes the world, does that give you an advantage as you look at your recommendations capability, what you have been building in terms of that database and cross-comparison of what people are buying in terms of across categories and products?  And then I guess is it international growth that is incrementally much better on units that is driving it.  It seems like domestic has been good, but international seems to be kicking in even more so these days than ever before. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP & CFO    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     In terms of the -- again, your unit question is related to mobile or is it related to total? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jeetil Patel,  Deutsche Bank Securities - Analyst    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Total. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP & CFO    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     No, again, the unit growth is very broad.  And so again, when you see the results that we had with on a local currency basis international being up 37%, this is revenue I'm speaking, as well as North America again was up 47%, 46% on a local currency basis.  You're seeing strong revenue growth.  You are also seeing very strong unit growth in those two segments.  And in terms of mobile, we are going to use -- obviously try to make sure that we learn as much as we can and try to serve our customers the best we can in that environment.  But it is an environment that we like.  Again, the idea of having easy access from a Web perspective on wireless devices is a world that we like.  So again, we are going to do whatever we can to make sure it is easy for customers to get access.

Steve Weinstein,  Pacific Crest - Analyst    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     I don't know if you you would be willing to disclose it, but I'm trying to get a better understanding of how might Zappos impacted the quarter.  If you could at least give us a sense of what the organic growth would have been without that.  But I also would love to know if there's any other impact to the P&L.  I just wanted to make sure the worldwide unit growth of 40%, that is excluding Zappos, correct? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP & CFO    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     No.  The worldwide unit growth includes Zappos.  The impact on some of the -- someone had asked that -- I apologize -- someone had asked a similar question earlier.  We are not breaking out Zappos results specifically as part of our total.  But what I had mentioned was, if you take our worldwide results on a local currency and growth basis and you back out Zappos and the Kindle accounting change, you see a growth rate that accelerated from Q4.  And that is accelerated versus what we saw in Q4, excluding exchange and excluding Zappos.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Imran Khan,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     I have two quick modeling questions and then one more of a big picture question.  In terms of modeling questions, I think on your other operating expenses/income net was $26 million, could you explain what that was, please?
 And secondly, fulfillment seems like it came down quite a bit at 7.4% of revenue.  Is that sustainable?  How should we think about that?
 And the long-term question is, I think the shareholder letter Jeff talked about how you launched 21 categories worldwide.  Can you give us some sense how long it takes to ramp those categories, how long it takes to get to the peak margins now that we have the experience of launching many different categories over the last many, many years.  So that would be very helpful.  Thank you. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP & CFO    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Could you just repeat -- there was a part in the middle there that I missed.  You said something about 7.4%.  I did not hear -- 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Imran Khan,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     That is the fulfillment.  Fulfillment as a percentage of revenue, I believe, was 7.4%. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP & CFO    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Does your question relate to that? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Imran Khan,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Yes, so that is down 80 basis points year over year.  So I was trying to figure out if that is a one-time thing or how should we think about it?  Is that sustainable, trying to figure out what is driving that leverage? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP & CFO    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     I will start with the fulfillment one first.  What you are seeing there is we saw accelerated growth, and when you see accelerated rate, we are able to leverage that in our fulfillment capacity in a great way from a productivity standpoint.  Also, what I had mentioned was we have added capacity, but specifically in North America we have not added any meaningful capacity since Q3 of '08.
 And if you recall, we were building capacity, and then we had a financial disruption in the market.  So we ended up having some excess capacity in Q4 of '08.  We have been able to leverage that capacity throughout, and so that is resulting in the productivity that you are seeing.
 Now with the growth that we are experiencing, you should expect that we will have to add capacity over time here to satisfy that growth.
 In terms of your category question, we have learned a lot over the years, but it still takes us a number of years to get the scale when we launch new categories.  One of the things we have learned over the past several years is we need to make sure that we have great selection day one.  We need to make sure that we are pricing very competitively day one, even though we do not have necessarily the scale or the buying tools to purchase well day one.
 And so what that means usually is that we will have a lower contribution profit per unit generally early on.  And, as we learn those categories, we get better and better at sourcing and making sure we have the right inventory in place and all that.  So it takes a number of years before we get the scale in those categories and get meaningful free cash flow out of them.

     In regard to your question on what is behind the $26 million of operating expense, remember that we are amortizing intangibles in that line item.  There is a number of things that go into that, but it really is predominantly amortization of intangible assets.

     I'm wondering if you could discuss some initiatives around used products and particularly in EGM and what the strategy is there going forward?
 Another question would be discuss your private label strategy.  Are there any new trends there, any new categories that we should know about?
 And then finally, just for the modeling, was there any meaningful impact from videogame hardware shortages this quarter?

Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP & CFO    [46]

     In terms of used products, our strategy has been pretty consistent.  We have a platform that is available for sellers to sell used product, which is the predominant use.  We try to make that experience as good as we can both for the sellers and for customers so they can understand what the quality of the good is before making a purchase decision.
 We have done some private label as you mentioned.  There is not really a lot to speak of today about that.  But again, we do have some private label products out that we sell.  But the vast majority of the products we sell are not private label.

     A couple of things.  First, I know your Company does not like to waste money.  Usually you have a revenue decline into the summer, and you ramp up your facilities and your people kind of in third quarter.  Why earlier this year?  Do you feel really bullish as we go into the summer period?
 And then just to clarify, are you saying all of the acceleration on an ex-currency basis from 1Q versus 4Q is due to Zappos and Kindle amortization? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP & CFO    [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     I will start with the last question first.  No, on a global basis, excluding exchange, Kindle and the accounting change, we saw a few hundred basis points acceleration in growth.  So we did accelerate excluding those items.
 In terms of capacity, we are -- we do have high growth rates right now.  We have 40% unit growth, 46% revenue growth in Q1.  You see the guidance for Q2.  And so, as you would expect with that growth rate, we need to make sure we have the right amount of capacity and people on hand to serve.
 As part of that from a fulfillment perspective, we are growing our fulfilled by Amazon, our FDA business, which also requires capacity to do so.  So those are things that we view as high quality problems, but those are things that we certainly will have to add as we move forward, as well as other areas, other parts of our business that are growing in addition to those two.

     But you said that you are investing earlier this year than normal, or is it just maybe a little bit of a catchup to last year?  How would you phrase that, would you say? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP & CFO    [51]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     You know, I guess I would characterize it as we are trying to make sure we satisfy demand in our retail business and our third-party business that we fulfill, as well as Web Services businesses.  So those are the things we are trying to do in making sure that we have the right capacity on hand.

Spencer Wang,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [53]

     A question on e-books.  I guess, as you and the industry move more toward the agency model for digital books, it shifts the ability to set pricing to publishers.  I guess our understanding is you also have to charge sales tax, also.  So it would seem that your ability to leverage low price may be mitigated a little bit.  So I was wondering if you could just talk about how you would adjust your model to differentiate Amazon versus some of the other players in the context of the other two pillars, I guess, convenience and selection that you are focused on? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP & CFO    [54]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Sure.  One of the things that we are doing is we are expanding selection pretty dramatically.  When we launched two plus years ago with Kindle, we had approximately 90,000 titles.  Just recently we passed over 500,000 titles.  And so our vision, as we stated when we launched Kindle, is to have every book ever published in any language available for customers in under 60 seconds.  And that is still our stated long-term goal.  And so we're going to continue to add selection in support of that vision.
