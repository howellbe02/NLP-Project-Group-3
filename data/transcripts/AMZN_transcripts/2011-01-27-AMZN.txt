Presentation
Operator    [1]

           Good day and welcome to the Amazon quarterly conference call.  Today's conference is being recorded.  At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Mr.  Rob Eldridge. 

Rob Eldridge,  Amazon.com, Inc. - VP IR    [2]

           Hello and welcome to our Q4 2010 financial results conference call.  Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO.  We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.
 The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, January 27, 2011 only, and will include forward-looking statements.  Actual results may differ materially.
 Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 As you listen to today's call we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.
 During this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website.  You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures to comparable GAAP measures.
 Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2009.
 Now I will turn the call over to Tom. 

Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP, CFO    [3]

           Thanks, Rob.  I will begin with comments on our fourth-quarter financial results.  Trailing 12 month operating cash flow increased 6% to $3.5 billion.  Trailing 12 month free cash flow decreased 14% to $2.52 billion.  Return on invested capital was 34%, down from 66%.
 ROIC is TTM free cash flow, divided by average sold assets, minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter end.
 The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 465 million shares compared with 461 million shares.  Worldwide revenue grew 36% to $12.95 billion or 37%, excluding the $139 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates.
 We are grateful to our customers, who continue to take advantage of our low prices, fast selection and free shipping offers, including Amazon Prime.
 Media revenue increased to $5.23 billion, up 12%, or 13% excluding foreign exchange rates.  EGM revenue increased to $7.39 billion, up 60%, or 62% excluding foreign exchange rates.  Worldwide EGM increased to 57% of worldwide sales, up from 48%.
 Worldwide unit growth was 43%.  Active customer accounts exceeded 130 million.  Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million.  Seller units were 30% of total units.
 Consolidated gross profit grew 33% to $2.63 billion, and gross margin was 20.3%.
 Now I will discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation.  Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $2.01 billion or 15.5% of sales, up 101 basis points year-over-year.
 Fulfillment was $1.06 billion or 8.2% of revenue compared with 7.7%.  Tech and content was $456 million or 3.5% of revenue compared with 3.1%.  Marketing was $368 million or 2.8% of revenue, consistent with prior year.
 Now we will talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods we do not allocate segments or stock-based compensation or other operating expense line items.
 In the North America segment revenue grew 45% to $7.21 billion.  Media revenue grew 13% to $2.37 billion.  EGM revenue grew 71% to $4.56 billion, representing 63% of North America revenues, up from 54%.
 North America segment operating income increased 6% to $295 million, a 4.1% operating margin.
 In the international segment revenue grew 26% to $5.74 billion.  Revenue growth was 29%, adjusting for the $143 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact during the quarter.
 Media revenue grew 11% to $2.87 billion or 13% excluding FX.  And EGM revenue grew 46% to $2.83 billion or 50% excluding foreign exchange.
 EGM now represents 49% of international revenues, up from 43%.
 International segment operating income increased 3% to $327 million, a 5.7% operating margin.  Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates, international segment operating income increased 16%.
 CSOI grew 4% to $622 million or 4.8% of revenue, down 146 basis points year-over-year.  Excluding the $18 million unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI grew 7%.
 Unlike CSOI, GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense.  GAAP operating income was relatively flat at $474 million or 3.7% of net sales.  Our income tax expense was $84 million in Q4 or 17% rate for the quarter.
 GAAP net income was $416 million or $0.91 per diluted share compared with $384 million and $0.85 per diluted share.
 Now I will discuss full-year results.  Revenue grew 40% to $34.2 billion.  North America revenue grew 45% to $18.71 billion, and international grew 33% to $15.5 billion, 34% growth excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates.
 Consolidated segment operating income, or CSOI, grew 23% to $1.94 billion or 25% excluding $28 million of unfavorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange.  And operating margin decreased 75 basis points to 5.7%.
 GAAP operating income grew 25% to $1.41 billion or 4.1% of net sales.
 Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $2.4 billion year-over-year to $8.76 billion.  Inventory increased 48% to $3.2 billion.  And inventory turns were 11.4, down from 12.2 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories.
 Accounts Payable increased 44% to $8.05 billion, and Accounts Payable days increased to 72 from 68 in the prior year.
 Our Q4 2010 capital expenditures were $328 million.  The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, including investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services, capacity to support fulfillment operations, and investments in corporate office space.
 I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance.  Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we see to date, and what we believe today to be properly conservative assumptions.
 Our results are inherently unpredictable, and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy, consumer spending.  It is not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
 As we have described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance.
 Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.
 For Q1 2011 we expect net sales of between $9.1 billion and $9.9 billion, a growth of between 28% to 39%.  This guidance anticipate approximately 140 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates.
 GAAP operating income to be between $260 million and $385 million or between 34% decline and 2% decline.  This includes approximately $140 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.
 We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expenses, to be between $400 million and $525 million or between 21% decline and 4% growth.
 We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience.  We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.
 Thanks.  With that, Rob, let's move to questions. 

Rob Eldridge,  Amazon.com, Inc. - VP IR    [4]

           Great, thanks, Tom.  Let's move on with the Q&A portion of the call.  Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?



Questions and Answers
Operator    [1]

     (Operator Instructions).  So that everyone may have the opportunity to ask their question, we ask that you limit yourself to one question.  Mark Mahaney, Citi. 

Mark Mahaney,  Citi - Analyst    [2]

     Two questions.  First, on the gross margin trends, down a little bit year-over-year.  Would that have been impacted by the strong sale of Kindle devices in the fourth quarter?
 And secondly, could you just talk broadly about the Subscribe and Save offering that you have, and to what extent you have seen cross-selling into more consumer staple items amongst your customer base?  Thank you. 

Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP, CFO    [3]

     Sure.  And in terms of gross margins, you are seeing some volatility.  If you look at the individual quarters from 2010, you saw that we were down a bit in Q1, up the next two quarters slightly.  And then down a little bit in Q4 about approximately 45 basis points.
 We haven't been talking much about gross margins because we don't think it is that meaningful.  And that is why we are trying to point people to the bottom again.  The reason we are doing that is because of the mix of business.
 So what you're seeing there in some gross margins in Q4 is -- we have a very broad mix of businesses and geographies that are going into that number, and again, you're seeing some volatility in the individual quarters.
 But, again, we are very pleased with what we saw in Q4 in terms of growth in overall performance of the business.  And it reflects a very heavy investment load to support the growth that we expect.
 In terms of Subscribe and Save, could you repeat the question again, sorry? 

Mark Mahaney,  Citi - Analyst    [4]

     What kind of impact have you seen -- what kind of adoption rate have you seen for that?  And just broadly your penetration of consumer staples, spending amongst the Amazon customer base.  Thank you. 

Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP, CFO    [5]

     Sure, Subscribe and Save is going very well.  It is something that certainly our customers like a lot.  We are getting that benefit in the consumer portion of the consumer category today.  Again, it is something that we are excited about and customers are excited about.  So we are happy to offer it to them. 

Operator    [6]

     James Mitchell, Goldman Sachs. 

James Mitchell,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [7]

     Thank you for taking my questions.  If I could ask just two questions about revenue growth.  And I don't want to sound critical of revenue growth, because the absolute growth rates are very high.  But just digging into two components, first of all, is there any big obvious reason why international growth decelerated while domestic growth accelerated?
 Then, secondly, in the media business, if e-book sales are now bigger than paperback sales, and paperback sales continue to grow, is there a big obvious reason why total media sales are growing at 13% rather than a slightly faster number?
 I assume that the agency account e-books is part of that perhaps? 

Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP, CFO    [8]

     Okay, in terms of -- you're absolutely right -- in terms of overall growth we are very pleased with what we saw.  Just to kind of frame up that discussion a bit, we saw 40% growth year-over-year, total year 2010, which is the best growth rate we have seen since 2000.
 We saw Q4 growth rates overall of 37% on a local currency basis, which is -- matches our best growth rate for any Q4 we have had on a local currency basis since 2000.
 Then unit growth was 43%, which certainly going back several years we haven't seen a quarter -- any quarter that has had that growth.  So we're seeing very strong growth across many categories, across many geographies.
 In terms of the international growth specifically, if you look back to last year we did have very strong media growth in international in Q4.  You will see that it is up 26% on a local currency basis, which is one of the strongest quarters we have had, and we are overlapping that.  There were some new releases that were in Q4 last year, most notably the Windows 7 release, one; Dan Brown's book in Germany is another.  Those are a few examples.  But there are a few in the releases that were in there.
 The other piece too that we haven't -- it is certainly difficult to quantify, but there was certainly some impact from some of the weather that we saw in Europe during the month of December.  But, again, we are very pleased with the growth that we saw in Q4 in total, including international.  And we are happy with what we see there.
 In terms of some of your questions surrounding media, again, we are seeing good growth there.  As you mentioned, we are seeing so far quarter date this quarter we saw that Kindle books exceeded paperbacks, which is very exciting, and while having paperbacks continue to grow year-over-year.  So, again, we are seeing very strong growth there.  So, again, very pleased with the growth we are seeing across the business. 

James Mitchell,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [9]

     Is there a track on the media growth from the accounting for the agency e-books? 

Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP, CFO    [10]

     Could you say that again? 

James Mitchell,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [11]

     Is the fact that some of the e-books are being sold on an agency rather than a consignment basis this year acting as a drag on growth temporarily in terms of your reported revenue? 

Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP, CFO    [12]

     Certainly, the agency piece is included in the numbers that we have reported today, but in terms of the impact, we are not breaking that out.  But, again, we are very excited with the growth that we are seeing within books, e-books specifically, and physical books are going well as well. 

James Mitchell,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [13]

     Thank you. 

Operator    [14]

     Spencer Wang, Credit Suisse. 

Spencer Wang,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [15]

     Thanks for taking the question.  I guess two quick ones.  First, Tom, for the first-quarter guidance it would seem like your operating income guidance implies that you are still reinvesting in the business.  Could you just give us a little bit more color on is it still fulfillment centers, is it tech and content, all the above?
 Secondly, with the LOVEFiLM's acquisition, can you just walk us through the rationale and how you will integrate that with perhaps your other video on demand businesses?  Thanks. 

Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP, CFO    [16]

     Sure.  In terms of the guidance, let me just put that in context.  Now probably the best way to do it is just, again, a reminder on 2010, the fact that we had very strong growth, the best growth we have seen in 10 years.  Fourth-quarter matched the best -- on a local currency basis growth matched the best fourth quarter we have had since 2000.  And again, very strong unit growth, the best we have seen.
 With all that growth, we had to add a lot of capacity, most of which was in the second half of last year.  We added fulfillment capacity this quarter, retail business.  We added fulfillment capacity this quarter, growing Fulfillment by Amazon business as part of our seller business.  We added a lot of infrastructure capacity this quarter -- fast-growing AWS business as well as our retail business.
 So when you -- those are reflected -- when you look at our Q4 results and our 2010 results those are reflected in the CapEx numbers that you're seeing.  And those are reflected in the fulfillment, as well as the tech and content lines when you look at our operating expense line items.  So because it was largely back half of the year loaded, you are seeing more of that in Q1.
 So that are reflected in the growth rate.  Now the question will be -- we are not giving guidance beyond Q1, but what will this mean going forward?
 So one of the things that we are doing is certainly when you look at our Q1 guidance, you look at our topline guidance, we're cautiously optimistic about Q1 with very strong growth.  And we will have to see how much we invest throughout the year in 2011 based on that.
 But, again, I am very, very happy with the capital we are able to deploy.  You should keep in mind that with the sheer amount of capacity that we added in 2010 it doesn't become -- it is not fully utilized day one, and it is not -- we don't get the optimum productivity on day one.  So what that means is we get productivity on those operations.  We get returns on those assets that we deploy over a period of time.
 But if you look at our history, we've gotten very good returns on that capital.  So to me I'm very pleased to put that capital in place.  And if we have to add more in 2011 it will be a high-quality problem. 

Spencer Wang,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [17]

     And on LOVEFiLM? 

Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP, CFO    [18]

     LOVEFiLM, we think it is just a very exciting opportunity.  We have had a close association with that business for some time.  We are very pleased to be able to offer customers in the video space within Europe their offering.  So, again, we are very excited about it, and you will have to stay tuned on that one. 

Spencer Wang,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [19]

     Thanks, Tom. 

Operator    [20]

     Doug Anmuth, Barclays Capital. 

Doug Anmuth,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [21]

     Thanks for taking the question.  A few things.  First, I just wanted to ask in terms of the revenue growth that you are expecting for 1Q, can you give us a sense of how much you are anticipating from acquisitions?
 Then, secondly, if you could comment just on your thinking around the Living Social investment?  And also what you may have learned from the recent daily offer which you ran within the last week or so?  Thanks. 

Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP, CFO    [22]

     In terms of the guidance for Q1, specifically, in terms of acquisitions, LOVEFiLM or Quidsi, which haven't closed yet, are not reflected in guidance.  So those are not in our Q1 numbers.
 In terms of Living Social, we are very pleased with the investment that we have made there.  In terms of any commentary on their recent deal, the recent one-day offer that they had, we are very excited that they offered Amazon gift certificates.  And we think it is great for customers and we are happy to enable that. 

Doug Anmuth,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [23]

     Thanks, Tom. 

Operator    [24]

     Brian Pitz, UBS. 

Brian Pitz,  UBS - Analyst    [25]

     Two questions.  First, an update on AWS.  It looks like Other revenue in North America slowed pretty significantly.  And I realize that is a decent part of Other.  Any commentary on what was the main driver of that slower growth?
 Second, on grocery, can you give us a little more insight on your initiatives there and the potential cost impact from expanding those categories?  Thanks. 

Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP, CFO    [26]

     Sure, in terms of AWS, we are extremely pleased with how AWS is going.  It is growing at a very fast rate.  We are investing in that business to support that growth rate.
 You're correct in terms of seeing the North America Other growth rate drop from 52% to 45% year-over-year from Q3 to Q4.  Keep in mind that there is a number of things in there, including AWS, that tend to be a little lumpy.  But we did see actually an acceleration of growth in AWS from Q3 to Q4.
 So built into that number it actually accelerated.  So, again, we are very pleased with the growth that we are seeing there.
 In terms of grocery, we have two things that you probably could be referring to.  One is our dry goods business, which is what is in our consumer business that we are very pleased with that we have on Amazon.com as well as some other sites.
 In addition to that, we have a local test here in Seattle called Amazon Fresh.  Again, that is a test that we have been conducting.  We are pleased with how the test is going, but again, it is a test and we will continue to see how that goes and see if we invest further on that test.
 Again, we do a number of tests in different parts of our business, and that happens to be one of them.  We have a great team that is working on it, but you will have to stay tuned to see if we do more there. 

Brian Pitz,  UBS - Analyst    [27]

     Great, thanks. 

Operator    [28]

     Youssef Squali, Jefferies. 

Youssef Squali,  Jefferies - Analyst    [29]

     Thank you very much.  Two quick questions.  One, Tom, can you tell us how many distribution centers you actually had at the end of 2010?  I know you're not going to guide to 2011, since you are guiding to Q1, are you planning on opening any distribution centers?  And what is your CapEx for Q1? 

Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP, CFO    [30]

     Sure, in terms of -- we had approximately -- approximately 52 at the end of 2010.  We added 13 last year.  We will add more fulfillment centers this year.  We haven't said -- we are not saying how many yet, because again we are trying to determine what the growth rate will be.  And based on what we have seen Q1 we are certainly cautiously optimistic, which is reflected in the growth rate you see for guidance for Q1.
 So we will have to wait and see, and we will be back with you as we go throughout the year.  But just to be clear, again, I mentioned in one of the other questions, I think, it would be a very high-quality problem.  The reason why I say that is what our teams are doing around the world right now, which is the same thing we have been doing for the last 15 or 16 years in working with our various fulfillment centers, is even though we are not fully utilized in some of these new assets that we deployed in 2010, or our productivity is not optimum, that team is working -- will work to utilize those assets as we continue to grow.
 We will get better and better productivity as we go, just like we have in our other fulfillment centers around the world that we have had experience with.  So we are very excited about that.
 So when will you think about the fulfillment centers, even though they can be a little bit dilutive in the short term by looking at our fulfillment expense, the reason why I'm very excited about it is you can just look at our return on invested capital.  If you take our return -- our invested capital at the end of 2010, we had approximately $7.4 billion of invested capital.  That is a 5 point average over the last five quarters.
 If you take out cash and marketable securities over those same periods that is about $6.5 billion.  So we have about $900 million of invested capital, and even with our heavier spend in CapEx last year, we generated $2.5 billion in free cash flow.  So we have in excess of 250% return on our invested capital ex cash from marketable securities.
 So again, that is a full business.  It includes a lot of things over a period of time.  But if you think about that capacity, where we need it because of growth, we are certainly very happy.  We do it judiciously and make sure we do it appropriately, but we are very happy to deploy that capital to get great returns for shareholders over time.
 Again, the returns that we have gotten are certainly historical and not predictive, but again, we are very happy to deploy that capital, and I feel very good about it. 

Youssef Squali,  Jefferies - Analyst    [31]

     Are you quantifying CapEx for Q1 or no? 

Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP, CFO    [32]

     No, we haven't quantified the CapEx for Q1, I apologize.  But, again, we will do what we need to do to support the growth in both infrastructure and fulfillment. 

Youssef Squali,  Jefferies - Analyst    [33]

     Thanks. 

Operator    [34]

     Colin Sebastian, Lazard Capital Markets. 

Colin Sebastian,  Lazard Capital Markets - Analyst    [35]

     One follow-up on the gross margins.  I think historically Amazon's pricing philosophy has been to to be a price follower.  I guess I'm curious if perhaps you are loosening that strategy up a bit, maybe to be a price leader in more categories?  Thanks. 

Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP, CFO    [36]

     In terms of pricing, we have had a number of different strategies over the course of our history.  But certainly our objective is to have great values for customers over all of our selection, over all of our geographies.  And that hasn't changed.
 So we are very excited to offer customers that.  It is the reason -- certainly one of the drivers for the growth that we have been able to have over our history.  And so, one of the things that we do do is when we enter a new category and add selection within that category we price it day one as competitively as we can.
 So, in other words, we price it competitively day one based on the intelligence we have.  And sometimes that means that it is very low gross margin, because we are just entering those particular categories with those particular items.  And that is something we have been consistently doing for a number of years, and we like that kind of strategy. 

Colin Sebastian,  Lazard Capital Markets - Analyst    [37]

     Thank you. 

Operator    [38]

     Ben Schachter, Macquarie. 

Ben Schachter,  Macquarie - Analyst    [39]

     There is a lot of interest and how the Kindle ecosystem actually impacts to the margin.  I was wondering if you could just help us understand -- well, one question would be all-in Kindle hardware and software, the whole thing together, how is that impacting gross margin?
 Then overall how should we think about how the agency model and the e-books, how that is going to impact margin?
 Then just one quick one.  There has been some speculation about the potential to bundle services with Amazon Prime.  I was wondering if you could tell us how you think about that, and is that something that may be interesting in the future?  Thanks. 

Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP, CFO    [40]

     Sure.  First of all, we have a long-standing practice of not breaking out any individual products or categories.  But what I can say about Kindle is it is growing very fast.  We are extremely pleased with what we are seeing.  We sold millions of devices in Q4.  The content business -- the content part of it is growing very fast as evidenced by some of the comments we put in the earnings release.
 So far quarter-to-date this quarter, again Q1, we have Kindle content, Kindle books sales growing at a faster rate than paperbacks, Which is really exciting.  And so that business is going very well.  And with the opportunity that we see there we are continuing to invest in that business.  We think it is a very good business for us, and we are excited about the long-term opportunity there. 

Operator    [41]

     Justin Post, Banc of America - Merrill Lynch. 

Justin Post,  Banc of America - Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [42]

     One quick follow-up.  Maybe you could explain why Kindle is a better business for Amazon?
 And then, secondly, you talked about gross margin maybe not being the best way to measure the Company.  Maybe you could explain why operating margin is better.  And do you have individual management targets as far as compensation, or as a company as a whole on where you want to get to for operating margins?  Thanks. 

Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP, CFO    [43]

     I am not sure I understood the first part of your question related to Kindle. 

Justin Post,  Banc of America - Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [44]

     I guess I am asking why Kindle is a better business than your traditional bookselling media business? 

Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP, CFO    [45]

     Well, we happen to like both.  Even though we are extremely excited about our Kindle business, our physical book business continues to grow as well.  So we are very excited about both parts of our business.
 And again, we think -- when I was mentioning Kindle, we just think it is a great opportunity for us.  It has great tracks right now.  Customers like it.  We are able to offer so many titles right now in less than 60 seconds right to -- for a customer to be able to read.
 One of the things you can't do with a physical book is you can't, from a service perspective with our model, it is very difficult to get it to the customer now.  And with Kindle we can do that in less than 60 seconds.  You can carry around your library with you very lightly.
 And so we think it is just great for customers.  We are seeing that the growth, both in terms of devices and content, is just fantastic.  So we are continuing to invest and continuing to improve that experience for customers.
 In terms of gross margins versus operating margins, we actually don't focus a lot on individual percentages, whether it be gross margins or operating margins.  We are focused ultimately over the long term on free cash flow, free cash flow per share.
 We like to look at return on invested capital.  I mentioned earlier what our return on invested capital is today.  That includes, appropriately so, the cash and marketable securities that we have in that balance.  But certainly if we were to deploy that cash and return that to shareholders over time, you can see the underlying returns on invested capital ex cash are very high and in excess of 250% right now.
 So we think it is a very efficient capital business.  We think that we certainly like the model that we have and the opportunity that it brings to the shareholders over the long term.

     A couple of questions.  First of all, I guess when you look at the Kindle side of the equation, do you believe that the proliferation of Kindle apps across devices, not just your own device, is helping to increase the overall consumption of books across the industry or Amazon?
 Then, second, I guess as it relates to international, where do you stand in terms of pan-European fulfillment capabilities, say shipping from Germany into the Netherlands into Scandinavia, et cetera? 

Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP, CFO    [48]

     In terms of Kindle apps we think it is good for customers that they can read their book -- their Kindle books on the other Kindle as well as many other devices.  So that is what you see today.  We have these apps so that it is easy for customers to be able to do that.  Customers like that feature.  And you should expect us to continue to expand that over time.
 So how much it is contributing to overall growth is hard to say.  But, again, customers are responding to the vast selection that we have, the good prices -- the great prices we have for Kindle content, the ease of which they can carry it around with them with a great convenience on their device, the Kindle device itself.  So we are very excited about it.
 In terms of fulfillment, we continue to work with our fulfillment to make it as seamless as possible for customers.  That is really what it's all about in each of the geographies we are in.  And we will continue to do so.  So wherever we can make that service within Europe better for customers, we will.  It will come from whatever fulfillment center makes sense. 

Jeetil Patel,  Deutsche Bank Securities - Analyst    [49]

     If I may ask a follow-up.  You have had tremendous growth in customers over the past year, about 24 million or so.  Yet do you think that your lifetime value of the customer equation has changed, particularly as you looked at -- you have initiatives like Kindle and Prime?
 Do you think that the economics have changed obviously for the better that you are acquiring more aggressively?  Is that how we should think about some of these newer initiatives that you have had over the last several years that have been -- certainly they are pretty impactful? 

Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP, CFO    [50]

     No, I think, not commenting on the lifetime value of customers, but we continue to offer new things for customers to make the experience better for customers.  So we are adding new selection to make that better for customers.  We are adding -- we launched Prime a number of years ago, which continues to grow, because we wanted to make sure that we could give great service to customers.
 Many of our digital initiatives are around how do we make sure we get customers not only great -- give great pricing, great selection, but they get to have their content immediately.
 So those are things that -- with us we start with the customer first.  That is where our focus is.  We found that by aligning with the customer it has been great for customers as well as great for shareholders over time.  So that is the focus that we have had and the driver behind the initiatives over the past several years.

     A question on marketing.  If we look at marketing as a percentage of revenues this year it was up.  And I believe you said one of the main reasons was the inclusion of Zappos.  As we think about your marketing spend in 2011 is that the sort of seasonality and pattern that we should look for, or is anything changing in your approach to marketing?  Thanks. 

Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP, CFO    [53]

     Well, we did -- certainly we added -- continue to support the Zappos marketing spend in 2010 was a part of it.  We are always looking for ways to reach customers through our marketing spend.
 We also did -- you probably noticed a fair amount of Kindle ads during 2010, primarily starting, for the most part, heavier after Q1 of last year, which we saw great response to.  So, again, those are some of the dynamics to think about. 

Jim Friedland,  Cowen and Company - Analyst    [54]

     Okay, great.  Thank you.

Steve Weinstein,  Pacific Crest - Analyst    [56]

     I had a question on Prime membership.  Now that it has been active in the US for quite a long time now, are you still seeing new members adopting Prime at a rapid rate?  And I'm wondering when you think that may plateau as far as penetration in terms of the existing customer base? 

Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP, CFO    [57]

     It is a good question.  We are seeing adoption of Prime in our geographies continue to grow nicely.  Customers like Prime.  They like the service element of Prime.  We have different offerings depending on the geography that we are offering it in.  In the US you can get express two-day shipping for free.  You get one-day and also some other offers in terms of weekend offers as well.
 So, again, there are some interesting service elements to that, and customers are responding very well to it.  It is both existing customers as well as -- sorry, existing Prime members as well as new Prime members.  So it is going very well. 

Steve Weinstein,  Pacific Crest - Analyst    [58]

     I guess I am asking -- do you think you're reaching any sort of ceiling in terms of how many (multiple speakers)? 

Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP, CFO    [59]

     No. 

Steve Weinstein,  Pacific Crest - Analyst    [60]

     No? 

Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP, CFO    [61]

     No.  And again, hard to tell when that would happen, but that certainly -- that is not what we are experiencing. 

Steve Weinstein,  Pacific Crest - Analyst    [62]

     Great, thank you.

     Heath Terry, Canaccord. 

Heath Terry,  Canaccord - Analyst    [64]

     I was wondering if you could give us a sense, is there a way to quantify the amount of time necessary for the recently opened distribution facilities to get to the same utilization level that you are seeing in the rest of the business?  What kind of impact do you think that has on operating margins to the extent that you can quantify that for us?
 In light of the investments this quarter, I guess it is worth at least asking, if you still feel like 10% is the right long-term operating margin to be thinking about for the total -- for the whole business? 

Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP, CFO    [65]

     Sure, in terms of when these fulfillment centers will reach their optimum utilization and productivity, we are still getting productivity on existing fulfillment centers that we have had for quite some time.  So it will be something that will evolve over a longer period of time.  But again, if you look at the returns that we've gotten on the previous fulfillment centers that we have launched, they have been great uses of capital.  So we are very happy about that.
 In terms of your question on double-digit operating margins, we have said for a long time, and nothing has changed in that regard, we think that certainly double-digit operating margins are possible.  If it means that we have some high single-digit operating margins that maximizes free cash flow, we are certainly okay with that and have room to go there.
 But we are certainly focused on how do we get the best free cash flow, free cash flow per share, while getting great efficiency on our invested capital.  So nothing has changed there. 

Heath Terry,  Canaccord - Analyst    [66]

     Great, thanks, Tom.

Sandeep Aggarwal,  Caris & Company - Analyst    [68]

     Thanks for taking my questions.  Tom, in our assessment there are many international markets which have grown healthier than the growth you achieved in Q4.  I know it is a blended growth number and probably some FX dynamics, but are you saying any basically local e-commerce players getting stronger in international markets?
 Secondly, any early signs of traction for the launch of the site in Italy?  Thank you. 

Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - SVP, CFO    [69]

     Again, we grew 29% on a local currency basis for international, 26% on a dollar basis, a challenging compare from fourth quarter of 2009 where we certainly from a media perspective had one of our best growth rates that we have had in any quarter previously.
 EGM grew at 50% on a local currency basis, so very strong growth.  Again, we have a long-standing practice of not talking about other companies, but we are very pleased with what our international team is doing.  We have a great opportunity there for further growth.  In terms of Italy, very early, but pleased with what we are seeing so far, and like the opportunity there. 

Sandeep Aggarwal,  Caris & Company - Analyst    [70]

     Thank you.
