--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colette Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - EVP & CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Arnab. Q3 revenue was a record $1.305 billion, up 7% from a year earlier, up 13% sequentially and substantially above our outlook of $1.18 billion. Growth was driven by record revenue for gaming, particularly for our GTX Platform and Automotive Infotainment Systems. From a reporting segment perspective, GPU revenue was $1.11 billion, up 12% from a year earlier. Tegra processor revenue was $129 million, down 23% from a year earlier. 
Our strategy remains focused on creating platforms for gaming, professional visualization, Datacenter, and Automotive. Our progress is the result of product innovation, our strong position in growing markets and disciplined execution. In Q3, our four market platforms contributed 85% of our revenue, up from 71% a year earlier. 
First, let's start with our gaming platform. Gaming revenue rose 44% year on year to $761 million. Growth is being fueled by a number of factors. Among them: the significant increase in graphics production value; the rise of eSports; the anticipation of blockbuster games for the holiday season; and the emergence of new technologies like VR, for richer, more immersive game play. Professional gaming competitions, or eSports, are well on their way to becoming a global entertainment category with an audience of 188 million viewers. There were 30 million viewers alone from last month's League of Legends World Championship. The launch of great gaming titles drives gaming platform sales. 
We are excited about the strong pipeline of AAA games ready for the holiday season, including Star Wars Battlefront, Call of Duty: Black Ops 3, Rainbow 6, and Fallout 4. Meanwhile, we are looking forward to the launch of virtual reality with the approaching availability of VR headsets from Oculus, HTC, and others as well as new VR games such as EVE Valkyrie. During the quarter, we enabled a new category of high capable enthusiast-class gaming notebooks with the launch of GTX 980. For the first time, notebooks are able to deliver the same gaming experience as desktops and have the processing power to drive frame rates needed for VR. 
Our long term bet on Android gaming is SHIELD. During the quarter, we extended the reach of SHIELD Android TV, the market's most advanced 4K smart TV console in two key European markets. We launched GeForce NOW which provides Netflix-like service for streaming games from the cloud to your SHIELD device. 
Moving to professional visualization. Quadro revenue increased 8% sequentially to $190 million, a decline of 8% year over year. At the SIGGRAPH Professional Computer Design Conference, we introduced NVIDIA DesignWorks. This suite of algorithm libraries and tools enables developers to easily incorporate photo realistic visualization of product and building designs. And with DesignWorks VR, developers can easily provide the amazing experience for such areas as theme park design, product design, tele-presence and surgical training. 
In Datacenter, inclusive of Tesla and GRID, revenue rose 13% sequentially to $82 million, reflecting demand in deep learning, high performance computing, and graphic virtualization. Revenue declined 8% year on year due to lumpiness from large deep learning projects. Most of the world's leading web services companies have adopted Tesla for deep learning to power next-generation services. In addition to using our GPUs for training servers on massive data sets, companies  like Baidu are using them for inference for such work as real-time voice recognition. In high performance computing, we increasingly find that GPUs are moving from the domain of researchers to commercial use, in such areas as weather forecasting and seismic processing. 
We continue to make progress as well with our GRID  virtualization platform which enables companies to deliver graphic-rich applications to employees on any device anywhere. At VMworld in San Francisco, we launched GRID  2.0 with twice the user density and application performance of its predecessor and support for both Linux and blade servers. A dozen Fortune 100 companies are completing trials of GRID  2.0 and more than 125 OEM offered servers are qualified to run it. Also reflecting momentum for NVIDIA Datacenter  offerings, Microsoft Azure announced it has integrated NVIDIA GRID  into its rapidly growing cloud service in response to customer and demand for GPU acceleration in the cloud. 
Finally, Automotive revenue rose 51% year on year to a record  79% -- $79 million. At last month's International Auto Show in Frankfurt, Mercedes Benz, Audi, Porsche, Bentley and Honda all showcased a range of production vehicles and concept cars with NVIDIA-powered digital cockpits and our partner, Tesla Motors, just introduced its Falcon Wing Model X, like the Model S, the Model X is equipped with both a multi-touch infotainment system and a digital instrument cluster, powered by NVIDIA. 
Finally, we are continuing deeper collaborations with over 50 companies that are developing self-driving car technologies using NVIDIA Drive PX. These include car manufacturers, Tier 1 OEMs, start ups, and research institutions. Drive PX is an advanced autonomous driving platform that fuses data from Cameras, LiDars, Radar, and Ultrasonic Sensors to determine the path forward using deep learning techniques. We look forward to sharing more details about this work at CES 2016.  Our OEM and IP business was $192 million, up 11% sequentially, driven by seasonal demand for notebooks. 
Now turning to the rest of the income statement.  GAAP gross margin was 56.3%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 56.5%, in line with our outlook. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin increased from a year ago, reflecting our strong gaming revenue. GAAP gross margin increased sequentially as the previous quarter included a charge related to the NVIDIA SHIELD tablet recalls. Non-GAAP gross margin was nearly flat sequentially. GAAP operating expenses for the third quarter were $489 million, inclusive of $8 million of restructuring and other charges. Non-GAAP operating expenses, including litigation charges, were $430 million, slightly lower than our outlook. We continue to focus on operating efficiencies and we manage investment growth while growing operating margins. 
GAAP operating income for the third quarter was $245 million, up 15% from $213 million a year earlier, reflecting strong revenue growth. Non-GAAP operating income was $308 million, up 17% from $264 million a year earlier. GAAP net income was $246 million. GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.44 including $0.01 of restructuring and other charges as well as a benefit of $0.09 from a tax reserve release. Non-GAAP net income was $255 million. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.46, an increase of 18% year over year. 
Now turning to some key balance sheet items. In Q3, our cash and marketable securities balance was $4.73 billion. During the third quarter, we paid $53 million in cash dividends and we closed on seller [repurchasing] agreement with an additional 4.6 million shares returned. As a result, we've returned to shareholders an aggregate of $604 million FY to date of our full year intent to return $800 million. As part of our ongoing commitment to deliver shareholder value through capital return, we have announced an 18% increase to our quarterly cash dividend to $0.115  per  share to be paid on December 14 to all shareholders of record on November 20. In addition, we are pleased to announce our intention in FY17 to return approximately $1 billion to shareholders through ongoing quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases. 
Now turning to the outlook for Q4 of FY16. We remain excited about our business prospects. Gaming continues to accelerate in eSports, VR and a pipeline of exciting games will lift it further. GPU accelerated datacenters are expanding in both high performance computing and cloud, driven by the acceptance of deep learning techniques and the transition to autonomous driving is well underway. We have excellent positions in each of these growth markets. We expect revenue for Q4 of 2016 to be $1.3 billion, plus or minus 2%. Our non-GAAP and GAAP gross margins --  our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 56.7% and 57%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $503 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $445 million. 
For FY16, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses, excluding litigation costs, to be approximately flat with FY15. Litigation costs are anticipated to be in the range of $70 million to $80 million as we defend our intellectual property. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for Q4 of FY16 are both expected to be 20%, plus or minus 1%. 
The above GAAP outlook excludes restructuring charges which are expected to be in the range of $25 million to $35 million as we finalize the wind down of the Icera operations in Q4 of FY16. Further financial details, including the CFO commentary and revenue by market platforms, are available on our IR website. 
With that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator, will you please poll for questions?

Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you. 
(Operator Instructions) 
The first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Banc of America. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for the question and congratulations on the great results. For my first question, the last two quarters you have substantially exceeded your original outlook and PC gaming has been an important part of that. And I'm wondering the strength that you're seeing or the upside surprise that you have seen in both these quarters, has that come more from units? Has that come more from better mix or ASPs or share gains and more notably, how sustainable is this upside trajectory? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, Vivek, first of all, thanks. Well, I think that we've been consistent that our PC gaming business is driven by several factors. The first factor is the great AAA titles that are coming out with ever increasingly graphics production value. 
The second is just a number of eSports players that are growing around the world and it's a very social phenomenon. The more of your friends are joining eSports, the more you have to join eSports so that you can hang out with your friends. 
The third is the developing countries. One of the things about PC gaming and overall gaming is that you really need to have broadband access any more so that you can download these amazing games. And so as broadband adoption continues to grow in the developing countries, the PC is really the best way to get into gaming. 
 It's a platform that you need for your daily lives anyways and surely most young people need it for school. So that's been helpful. All of those factors have increased both the  units as well as the ASPs that we're enjoying. If you look at the size of the overall market, I think that it's probably fair to say that we're not fully penetrated. 
And our expectation is that as we look into next year, all of the great games that are coming out whether it's Call of Duty that's coming out or Star Wars that's coming out, or Assassin's Creed, or Tomb Raider and surely, everybody is quite excited about VR coming out in the beginning of next year. So I think there's several growth drivers that are still quite powerful and our expectations that this is going to be a large market going forward. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great,  thanks Jen-Hsun. And for my follow-up question, not to table it, but when I look at your Q4 guidance,  it's strong, better than expectations, but it sort of implies a flattish trends and what does -- is  usually a seasonally stronger quarter. If you could just give us some color on what segments just directionally do you think would be up or down versus Q3? Thank you. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well the guidance that we provide is the guidance that we think is best and balanced and we'll see how the quarter plays out, but there are -- the  gross drivers in our business overall, gaming is a growth driver and we just mentioned some of the dynamics that are underlying it. Data centers is a growth driver for us and I'm sure we'll be talking more about that during the conference call and then third, the Automotive business is a growth driver for us and so we have several growth drivers and -- but at this point, our guidance is the best we have to offer. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, thank you, Jen-Hsun. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC - Analyst    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. First question on the virtual reality as a driver. It seems that you have fairly low expectations for 2016. When you see the Oculus VR demos, I really leave with the sense that they could transform business processes for many different industries and it seems like a lot of potential. 
So I'm just trying to reconcile that kind of reaction that I've noticed versus your -- it seems like lower key expectations for virtual reality as a driver, so if you could help reconcile that, that would be great. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, first of all, Mark, we are over-the-top excited about virtual reality. There's nobody at NVIDIA who is low key about it. There's no question that when you enjoy the Oculus headset with GeForce GTX 980 or GeForce GTX Titan, it's -- the experience is unbelievable and recently, we even produced a whole family of notebooks that are able to enjoy VR directly from the notebook. And so we're super excited about VR. 
The sense of presence that you have in enjoying VR headsets, whether it's from Oculus or Vive, it's really fantastic. We also see that the applications of VR is quite sweeping. It could -- of course, we're quite enthusiastic about games and the games that we've seen are really amazing but it's used for industrial design, architectural design. It's used for whether it's medical imaging, even scientific computing. 
We're seeing entertainment on a  large scale entertainment, large format entertainment. And so we're seeing all kinds of applications from places all over the world. We're tracking over 250 companies now that are working with us on VR and it ranges everywhere from video games to entertainment to professional graphics, as I've mentioned. 
Our approach is to provide a platform by which all of the entire VR industry can be built upon and so we call it our DesignWorks VR for our Enterprise products, our professional products, and GameWorks VR, for our consumer products and by using -- by connecting to our APIs and connecting to our SDK, the performance and  the experience is just phenomenal. 
Now maybe your question is much more related to financials and I guess our approach there is to be as enthusiastic about the work that  we're doing to support the entire industry as it moves into VR. We're engaged deeply with the industry in doing so. 
I think that we built the premier platform for VR for both PC gaming as well as professional graphics, and as far as financial is concerned, I realize that the shipments hasn't really started yet. And I think that it's prudent to wait and see but our -- my expectation long term is that VR is going to be a very powerful growth driver for us. I mean, that is almost undeniable at this point based on everything that we've seen and all of the effort that's going into it. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC - Analyst    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's very helpful color, Jen-Hsun.  Thank you for that. A follow-up question, if I may. On the gaming software, the PC gaming software, there's a strong product cycle you've mentioned a number of times. Is there a risk that you have that this helps -- is partially helping to drive gaming GPU sales now and then there's some kind of a let up later on in, say, two or three quarters from now? How should we think about that? Is there a correlation between gaming software launches and lumpy shipments of gaming GPUs? Thank you. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, it's -- I guess in the end,  it's hard to predict. There's only a few things that we do know. The first principles of what we know are that the gaming market overall is growing. The number of eSports players is continuing to grow. The number of countries, developing countries that are now able to bring more people into gaming is growing as they continue to adopt broadband. 
The production value of the video games are just amazing. Boy, if you just look at Star Wars, and Assassin's Creed, and Call of Duty, and Tomb Raider, they are almost cinematic. So our expectation is that these factors combined is going to continue to drive the gaming market forward. And so what we'll see from quarter to quarter how they do but at the moment, everywhere in the world, we're just seeing gaming to be quite vibrant. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC - Analyst    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, thanks a lot, Mark. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The next question comes from the line of Steven Chin with UBS. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steven Chin,  UBS - Analyst    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great, thanks for taking my questions. First one, Jen-Hsun,  if I could, on the Automotive market. I guess first of all your last Analyst Day, you guys mentioned an aggregate backlog number for an estimate on the rough value of the design wins over a number of years looking out. I was wondering if you could potentially provide us an update on how that number may have changed over the last several quarters? 
And related to that, just given the nice pipeline you guys have building up, can you talk about what sense of urgency your customers are telling you guys in terms of how quickly you need to get Tegra into some of these systems, whether it's infotainment or ADAS-type products and what that translates to in terms of the revenues coming on for Tegra? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks a lot, Steven. I guess, first of all, our Automotive business is growing quite robustly and year over year, it's grown over 50%. And our expectation is that it's going to continue to grow through next year and a couple years after that. Meanwhile, there are two very important dynamics that are happening in the car industry that is very favorable for us. 
One dynamic has to do with the central car computer. It is very clear now that your future car will be software defined; that there will likely be multiple operating systems. These operating systems will control graphics-rich experiences that this centralized computer will be built like a Datacenter  so that it could be secure, it could be robust, it could be mission critical. 
And software is going to play just a huge role in it, and so when the car becomes more and more computerized, more than just digital, more than just electronic but it's computerized and that it's software rich, it plays into our hands because we're such a great software company. We know system software incredibly well and software capability is one of our major differentiating advantages. It's one of the reasons why we're able to do what we do. 
The second dynamic is that whereas the first generation of driver assistance was made possible with radars and the second generation included cameras, the first generation of autonomous driving is about to come. Autonomous driving hasn't really made its way into the market yet and we're seeing early versions of that but architectures that enable fully autonomous driving is yet to come and this is an area where we really have a great deal of capability. 
It's going to require sensor fusion; it's going to require an enormous amount of software. It's going to require artificial intelligence;  and it's going to require the ability to support an open computing platform that NVIDIA is built upon. If you look at our accelerated computing platform, it's programmed by so many people in the world and this is a real advantage because car companies need the ability to develop their own artificial intelligence network so that they can ultimately own their driving experience. 
And so this is something that I think the second, the new era of autonomous cars and autonomous vehicles is a great opportunity for us.  So those two dynamics are going to be fundamental to the future growth of our Automotive business. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steven Chin,  UBS - Analyst    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, thanks for that color, Jen-Hsun. And as my follow-up question, I was wondering if you could help parse out some of the drivers within the Tesla and GRID  product families? Just between the  high performance computing, cloud Datacenter  and attrition all corporate enterprise type customers that are buying your Tesla and Group products, can you talk about the new medium term demand trends across the different verticals? Thanks. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, appreciate that question. PC gaming, of course, is a very powerful growth driver for us. Our Automotive business is a growth driver for us and I fully expect our Datacenter  business to be a growth driver for us. We've simplified our Datacenter  strategy over the course of the last several quarters. Whereas we used to have multiple Datacenter  strategies, we now have basically one Datacenter  platform with multiple applications that drive it on top. 
The Datacenter  platform accelerated the Datacenter  platform is called Tesla. On top of it,  we have multiple software stacks. The most -- the first software stack that we created was for high performance computing for scientists to be able to do things like weather simulations and molecular dynamic simulations and quantum chemistry simulations to material simulations, and so HPC, high performance computing, was our first stack. 
We also talked about GRID. GRID  is our Enterprise virtualization stack. We have GeForce NOW which is our cloud gaming stack and one of the things that's super important in the future is the work that we're going to do in hyperscale datacenters that allowed cloud datacenters to do their work around artificial intelligence and to take the pressure off of the enormous amount of new traffic that is swamping and flooding datacenters from users generating their own video. 
Basically, people are going to -- everybody is going to become a broadcaster and there are PC gamers that are already broadcasting on a daily basis and Twitch is the name by which we all know it by but you're going to see YouTube Live. YouTube Live is doing incredibly well and then you're going to see applications like Meerkat  and Periscope there are more coming that basically lets almost everybody become a broadcaster. 
You're going to have billions of people broadcasting to billions of other people and all of those videos today needs to be somehow processed and our GPUs are really fantastic at that. And so we have multiple ways to --  multiple applications, if you will, that sit on top of our Datacenter  platform. Now the dynamics that --  I've mentioned some. One of the most important dynamics around datacenters is Moore's Law needs a boost. 
We know now that Moore's Law  is under some amount of pressure and it's not growing as fast as the industry needs it to. So Moore's Law  needs a boost and that's really what Tesla is about. Tesla is an accelerated computing platform that boosts the microprocessor and so that's one dynamic. 
The second dynamic is what I mentioned. The global race to AI. The global race to AI. There's not one datacenter  on the planet. There's not one cloud service on the planet, frankly, there's not one application company on the planet that we know of that's not trying to figure out how AI can completely revolutionize the applications that they provide. 
And then of course, accelerating the cloud and making it possible for cloud to offer smart services and graphics rich services like the announcement that we recently did with Microsoft Azure. Azure now provides the NVIDIA GRID  to power graphics-accelerated applications as a service and we're super excited about that. So those dynamics are happening all in real-time and it's contributed to our sequential growth of 13%. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steven Chin,  UBS - Analyst    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, thanks, Jen-Hsun, and congrats on the strong results. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes thanks a lot, Steven. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hans Mosesmann,  Raymond James & Associates, Inc. - Analyst    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you. Congrats guys. Jen-Hsun, can you give us a quick rundown on the competitive dynamic in the datacenter,  particularly with GRID,  if there is any kind of competition and the reason I bring it up is that the Intel Altera combo perhaps is a way to fight what you guys are doing there, thanks. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, Hans, first of all, thank you. Well, I think that it's very clear at this point that boosting Moore's Law  is an essential path forward; that relying on CPU's alone for the entire work load of a datacenter  is unrealistic and frankly, unnecessary. There are no super computing centers  that I know of that are not considering accelerated computing and the reason for that is because just relying on traditional methods, unfortunately, doesn't allow you to scale your data center  in an efficient way any more. 
There are no hyperscale data centers that I know of that aren't somehow overwhelmed and flooded by the user-generated video content or the need to move to machine learning and artificial intelligence to provide smarter services. And so these dynamics are putting a lot of pressure on data centers and it's one of the reasons why there is so much talk about new approaches about improving the throughput of these data centers, whether it's super computing data centers or hyperscale data  centers across the board and I think that's an enormous opportunity for us. 
This is an area that we've invested almost 10 years in and as you know, I've been talking about accelerated data centers now for, well,10 years and this is an area that we're seeing a lot of momentum. And as other people pursue other ideas, I think that it's just acknowledgment that this is really a good path forward. 
I think that in your question, you also specifically asked about FPGAs. And FPGAs, we use FPGAs at NVIDIA and we use FPGAs to do simulations and emulations of our products. FPGAs have been around a long time and they have -- they're perfect for certain applications. The challenge for, I guess, the trade-off is an FPGA is like -- it's designed. It's designed and configured on an array of transistors  and gates whereas the GPU is a full custom processor that is designed completely by hand. 
Whereas one FPGA is designed probably by a handful  of engineers, a GPU is designed by thousands  of engineers. And a GPU performing a task could be 100 times the frequency, 100 times the performance  that of a FPGA, and it stands to reason that it's a result of hand craftsmanship and the processor that's designed to go very fast. An FPGA, however, can do specific tasks quite well. 
If you only want to do one or two things, you can surely limit the functionality and make an FPGA quite efficient; however, our perspective is that a data center doesn't do one or two things.  A data center  runs thousands of applications. A datacenter  has video, has imaging, it has voice, it does machine learning, the operatives are changing every day. Today, the algorithms are convolutional neural nets.  
Tomorrow, it has memory. After that it's recursive and so the type of neural nets just keep growing and the algorithms just keep on moving forward. And so our belief is that the vast array of applications and the evolution of the algorithms really makes a processor much, much easier to adopt and much faster to increase the overall throughput of your data center. And so we'll see how it plays out but at the moment we're seeing, we're enjoying a lot of enthusiasm around accelerated computing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kevin Cassidy,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for taking my question. I'm just wondering on GeForce NOW, how is that revenue going to be recorded as you start getting subscribers and is that going to go under GRID or is that going to go under SHIELD? And can you talk a little bit more about what gross margins are expected for that? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, the --  it's not very much right now so it's not much to talk about but I think that the way to think about it is this. SHIELD and GeForce NOW is our long-term bet on the future of gaming. When we look out in the future, I think  there are two dynamics that I think are unquestionable. One dynamic is that Android is going to become more important an operating system. 
Don't forget gaming is about computer gaming. Gaming is made possible because it's built on top of a computer architecture and Android is the most popular operating system in the world and so it's undeniable that it will become a major force in gaming some day and SHIELD is our bet in that. The second is that cloud services, application as a service and therefore, video games is an application, as a service, will eventually come. 
It took many years for Netflix to eventually become mainstream and my expectation is that it will take several years for GeForce NOW to become a --popular all over the world. And so those two dynamics I think are largely unquestionable. The question is not so much if. The question is simply when and then maybe the next question is who. 
Who is best equipped to be able to bring this future into a world and we feel that as the word leader in visual computing and as one of the major platform leaders in video games today, that this is an area that we can really make a great contribution. It's a modest investment for us and we're thoughtful about the level that  we invest to make sure that it times with long-term the opportunity, but the Board  to recognize the revenues,  just to put it back into the original question, if it  were to recognize the revenues, it would go into gaming. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kevin Cassidy,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, great, and maybe if I could just one other question about the split in the PC gaming business. Between notebook and I've seen a lot of reviews of the new gaming notebooks and seems all Top 10 are based on GeForce and between notebooks and your cards, what's the revenue split now? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, the revenue split is largely still PC desktops. I appreciate you bringing up the notebook work that we did. Maxwell, the GPU architecture that we created and in the craftsmanship of the GPUs we make are so incredible that it's finally possible for a notebook to be able to deliver the same level of performance as a desktop. 
And our timing was timed so that people who want to enjoy the ARC with a notebook can finally do it and so the latest generation of notebooks with GTX 980 are just amazing. 
They are so many times more powerful than the game console. It fits in a space smaller than a game console and it can drive VR. Everything you want to do, every game you want to play is possible on that thin laptop and so the enthusiasm behind our launch with GTX 980 has been really, really fantastic and I appreciate you recognizing it.

The next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ambrish Srivastava,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi, thank you. Two questions; one is back on the professional side. Just if I look at Quadro and Tesla, what reverses the year-over-year decline that we have seen the last couple of quarters? Is that, as it relates to Tesla,  is it just a matter of timing of when the HPC systems get launched? 
And the second follow-up was for you, Colette, on the IP side and the expenses for IP, what is the under -- it's not debatable that you guys have a very unique IP portfolio. But I'm wondering given the reversal, the initial reversal that you had on the lawsuit against Qualcomm and Samsung, why should the expenses be continuing to be higher on that front? Thank you. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure, thanks for the question, Ambrish. Let me take it in reverse order. So, first on IP. It's not over. We -- the Administrative Law Judge has opined that of the three patents that he had to rule on,  that two were not infringed and one was infringed but he opined invalid. Of course, we disagree with that and we have submitted our rebuttal and to the -- now all of that has to go to the Commission, which is ultimately where the ruling happens. 
The Commission -- the next phase is for the Commission to decide whether they want to review and we hope they do and it's not uncommon that they do. And then in the February time frame, the Commission would determine their judgment and it is not uncommon at all to have the Commission disagree with the Administrative Law Judge.  So I think that it's far from over and therefore, I guess it's not over. 
But I think the higher level point is this --  the higher level point is that our IP is very important to us. That invention, as the world leader in our field, is fundamental and core to our future. We have to invent the future. We are the world leader  after all. And from time to time, we may decide that as a one-off and  strategically decide that we would our IP, and this is what we have done in this case. 
But it's not our business model. We don't litigate for a business model. We don't depend on licensing for our business model. And I hope that all of you on the call today don't invest in our Company as a result of IP royalties. What I hope that you see is that we are quite a unique Company and we are a world leader in the space that we endeavor. 
That visual computing is more important than ever, and applies to more industries than ever, and that our business model is really about selling products into vertical markets that are really exciting and quite vibrant and growing. So I hope that you decide to invest on the basis of the products, the business model, and our special position in the marketplace. 
On the two questions related to Tesla and Quadro, as you know, Quadro is about design and it's about workstations, it's about manufacturing, it's about things that people make. And we are a very, very, very significant leader in this market. We make a great deal of contributions to this market, but it's also a mature market. 
And so the way that -- our strategy for growing Quadro is very, very simple. We have to reinvent it, and we have to reinvent it by bringing new capabilities to it, and we have two that we're quite excited about. One is a new technology called Iray, and Iray is a brand new way of generating images that is photorealistic and physically accurate. It's almost like inventing the font of desktop publishing. 
What you see is what you will get. And it's just really quite amazing. And so I think Iray is going to rejuvenate the way that people do computer graphics and it will create -- I hope that it will increase the size of the market, make it easier for people to design products, and it will increase our ASPs quite significantly. 
Number two, VR. We have already mentioned before that from design to architectural design to medical imaging to scientific computing, we're seeing that --  to a large scale entertainment. We're seeing that VR is going to be very important. So those two,  we hope,  will drive the future growth of Quadro and get it back on a growth track. 
As for Tesla, we grew 13% quarter over quarter. We declined year over year. Frankly, it didn't meet my expectation either. And however, the fundamental dynamics -- the reasons don't really matter here or there, but the fundamental dynamics are incredibly sound. And the groundswell around the fundamental dynamics is unquestionable. 
Moore's Law needs a boost. AI, every company on the planet is racing towards the future of AI, and cloud computing needs to be accelerated with graphics as Microsoft Azure has demonstrated. And so my expectation is that we'll grow sequentially again, and that the fundamental dynamics around Tesla is just really, really positive.

Your next question comes from the line of Deepon Nag. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deepon Nag,  Macquarie Capital  - Analyst    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes, Thanks a lot for taking my question. On virtual reality, so the recommended specs from Oculus are something like a GTX 970 [capacity], but I think a lot of third parties and I think even you guys have mentioned that it actually requires much more in order to get a pretty reasonable experience. 
So can you kind of help us understand what we should be expecting in terms of the average setup or what's called an early adopter of Oculus? Should we expect two GTX 970s, should we expect a GTX 980, a Titan? Anything would be helpful there. 
And then also if you could walk us through the economic fall through for NVIDIA in terms of what  revenues you would expect to see or ASPs NVIDIA would recognize for, let's say, a $300 card? And what  gross profit dollar fall through we can see from those as well? Thanks a lot. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, I appreciate that. So I would say that the GTX 970 is the minimum requirement. It is the minimum requirement. And I think Oculus has done a good job setting the minimum requirement. And I think a minimum requirement simply means that anything below it is not going to be a great experience. 
We're seeing just more and more content coming and usually, the content gets richer. Content doesn't usually move backwards. And so the production value is going to continue to grow. If you buy into a GTX 970, it will give you limited amount of growth over time, but if you buy into a GTX 980 or GTX Titan, you just have a lot more opportunities to continue to enjoy that platform for a longer period of time as content gets richer. 
And so in terms of the economics, our gross margins are higher on GTX 970 and above. It's higher than our corporate average. And so we appreciate the adoption and the growth in that segment of the marketplace. But ultimately, our focus is to help enable the entire ecosystem of hundreds of companies who are working on VR to be able to deliver this experience to the marketplace on -- and that fulfills the promise of VR. We're just intensely concerned that if we don't do a great job that we ruin a great thing. 
This is really, really a great thing, and the folks at Oculus and the folks at Valve, the folks at HTC, ourselves, and the 230 companies that are out there working on VR, we all want to deliver just a fantastic experience. And that's our focus at the moment, and our recommendation, if anybody were to walk up to me and ask me for a recommendation, I would tell them that a GTX 980 Ti would be the baseline. And in my own case, I'll probably have a pair of Titans, which who doesn't need a pair of Titans? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deepon Nag,  Macquarie Capital  - Analyst    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, that would be really nice for all of us. So then on that  same theme, if I think about the competitive dynamics into next year, so you -- I think, pretty obviously, have taken a significant leadership advantage, especially at that enthusiast portion versus AMD. As we go into VR, when you talk to the game developer community, what kinds of things are you doing in order to maintain that advantage? And what kinds of things could we see in Pascal that could actually allow you to extend that advantage? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, sure. Well, first of all, we respect our competitors. I mean, we take our competition seriously. You know that, as a Company, we compete pretty intensely. And this is a Company that has seen a lot of competition over the years. And so we take competition seriously. We respect the capabilities of our competition. 
However, I think it's also very, very clear that our business and our business model and our strategy is completely different than AMD and the PC graphics chip company we used to be a long time ago. And our Company is just on a different trajectory. Our approach to building products is different. Our approach at go-to-market is different. Our approach in engaging the ecosystem is different. I can't imagine a more different company to tell you the truth. 
And so as much as we are always alert and paranoid about -- and we don't take our position for granted, and we are thoughtful about competition, we have our own work to do and we have our own platform to do. And we have our own ecosystem to go and care for and nurture and push forward. And so I think that -- I appreciate the question, but I can't imagine a more different company to tell you the truth.

Jee-Hoon Seymore,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [46]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, congrats on a solid quarter. This is Jee for Ross Seymour. Just going back to the guidance, given that there's a slate of AAA rated games coming out this quarter, I guess why, what's the reason behind the conservatism behind the expectations for gaming or are -- is that growth expected to be offset by other segments? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Well, our guidance is the best guidance we think we should provide at this moment. And we'll see how the market plays out. We're not in control of the market, as you know. But I think at the foundational level, we have multiple growth drivers and some of them on some day exceeds our expectations and some of them don't exceed our expectations. But that's one of the benefits of our business model today. That's one of the benefits of our strategy today. 
We have multiple growth drivers in the Company. PC gaming is a growth driver. Artificial intelligence is a growth driver. VR is a growth driver. Autonomous driving cars  is a -- autonomous  cars  is a growth driver. And I really don't know of that many companies in the world that is working on these important dynamics in the industry that's going to shape the future of computing altogether. 
And so we have multiple growth drivers in our Company. And they're -- I believe that those drivers are fundamentally sound and powerful. However, we'll see how they turn out at the end of the quarter, and I remain optimistic. And so we're enthusiastic about the guidance we provided and are optimistic that we'll do a good job on it. And then we'll just have to see how it turns out. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jee-Hoon Seymore,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [48]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for my follow-up it looks like the segment --  revenue segmentations for the end markets was changed a little bit this quarter with the new classification of Quadro and data center  or Pro Visualization and data center  versus enterprise and HPC cloud. What was behind the change and is it related to the unifying of the data center  strategy? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, that's right. That's exactly right. The reason we decided to classify it a little differently is because I changed the architecture of it. We used to have several different product lines, and each one of the product lines were planned differently and they were specified differently, and so on and so forth. We decided to unify all of our data center product lines and abstracted out the software from it. 
And so from this one unified platform, Tesla, Tesla is our accelerated computing platform. And on top of it, our software stacks that allows us to solve a problem for a particular marketplace. So, for example, we have our entire software stack for HPC. We have a rich software stack for enterprise virtualization, we call Grid. 
We have a software stack that is incredible for providing cloud gaming around the world, that's called GeForce NOW and then we are going to have a software stack for hyperscale. And so each one of these software stacks are built on top of one common architecture, one common platform called Tesla Accelerated Computing. And so as a result, we decided to unify all of that and report it simply as datacenters. And, quite frankly, I think it will just be easier to understand.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Harlan Sur,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [52]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for taking my question and solid job on the quarterly execution. On the strong growth in the gaming segment; blockbuster games, eSports, big drivers, but there appears to be another potential driver and that is the shift from console to PC gaming here in the US.  
I think Jen-Hsun, you've always characterized the US  as a console-centric market. But this seems to be changing pretty rapidly with high schoolers and some of the older demographics here in the US.  I don't know what the stats are, but thus far, I think it's been a pretty big untapped market. So how much of this penetration is contributing to the growth in your gaming business? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [53]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, Harlan, first of all, thank you. I think that there is no question that the US -- even the US  is seeing growth in PC gaming and the fundamental reason is really quite singular, eSports. eSports is --  it may be the new social platform. It is the new digital playground. It is -- you go hang out with your friends. It's the new virtual arcade. This is how you hang out with your friends. 
 Not only do you play -- if you're not playing, you are watching, but at all times you're talking to your friends. This is how you hang out. And so this is a big deal. This isn't something you can do easily on mobile. This isn't something you can do easily on TV. This particular platform really, really benefits from having a PC. And so eSports is probably, if I had to tag it on one thing, eSports would probably be it. 
The growth of eSports, as you know, not only is the gamers enjoying eSports and growing faster than anybody would have expected, and I think the reason for that is because it's a social platform, and therefore, it grows not linearly but arguably exponentially. And in the case of eSports, there's also viewerships, and now all kinds of businesses are cropping up to help people enjoy watching eSports and sharing the moment with other people. So this is -- I  think this is real. And it's quite exciting.

Alex Gauna,  JMP Securities - Analyst    [60]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Powerful quarter. Congratulations everyone. Jen-Hsun, I know you touched upon the challenges and the datacenter for Moore's Law  and that driving opportunity for you but what are your own big picture thoughts on the implications of Moore's Law  for your core GPU business? 
And then associated with that,  if I think about the increasing challenges of Moore's Law  as well as the power of some of the big OEMs and it can be either on the hardware or cloud side and many of them or both, how does that not mean you need to have some sort of licensing business or strategic partnership business in order to move your technology forward? Thanks. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [61]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.  Alex, first of all, thanks for the question. Well, semiconductors and chips is really important to us. And on balance, it's a lot easier if the world will just get better without anybody having to work for it, i.e., Moore's Law. And so if every year, transistors just got faster and they got more of it,  and they got cheaper and so on and so forth, all at the same time, it surely would make for a easier ride. 
However, accelerated computing is a very different beast. The way that accelerated computing works and some people have characterized NVIDIA's growth and performance to Moore's Law squared. And I don't think it's much far off from that actually. And the reason for that has to do with the fact that we change our -- we can innovate change, improve our GPU underneath, the software stack on top, the algorithms that we innovate on top of that, and then also targeting specific applications. 
One of the things that most people don't realize is that we're not a general purpose processor. We only target a few specific applications. And the specific applications, as you know,  that we focus on,  is visual computing. And this particular field has become quite large. And because of the work that we have done, whether it's visual computing, images, video, and very parallel applications, which artificial intelligence falls into. 
These applications are just right down the strike zone and right in the bull's eye of accelerated computing. They just have -- maybe it happened by serendipity, but we hope that we had a large part to do with it that the accelerator that we created made it possible for these applications to move forward. 
And as a result, moved forward more quickly and became large markets. And so, I would say that the answer to your question is that we don't just do chips and the value proposition of our platform is really about chips, about software, about algorithms and applications that we select. And that combination is really, really powerful. 
Now your second question has to do with IP licensing. I would say that five years ago, as a technology component company, a PC graphics chip company where our path to market is only through OEMs. Our path to market is only through OEMs and our path to market is only through OEMs that are industry, where our products are industry standard width, i.e., Wintel or PC, or so on and so forth. That's no longer true. 
We now have four vertical markets by which we engage to market ourselves that we can go directly to the market, we can innovate openly and we have specialized platforms whereby we can innovate without dependency on somebody else. And so whether it's accelerated data centers, which has a specialized platform; gaming, where we go to market ourselves and we have a specialized platform there. These markets are really, really large. 
And so, the reinvention of our company put us in very large markets that are growing quite robustly. And so that  I think our primary focus today is through product sales. And so, we changed our business model that way, if you will, instead of remaining a components company and moving, if you will, backwards into licensing. We decided to move forward into the market vertically and creating specialized platforms.

Hi, Jen-Hsun. One question on the notebooks,  gaming notebooks. You indicated  that now you have the same desktop class graphics and notebooks and my question with that is with VR coming in and notebooks graphics getting more powerful, do you see that it could shift from desktops to notebook, your product mix? And if so, do you think that, that makes it less favorable or similarly favorable to you versus desktop graphics? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [64]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I actually  -- I guess I would say I don't care. I would say that I don't care and the reason for that is these desktop -- these notebook GPUs are really high end and they are all GeForce platforms to us. They all go to the same gamers, and so I think the most important thing is this that we would like the games to have higher graphics production value; the AAA games. 
 I would like eSports to continue to grow. I would like developing countries to have broadband and I would like VR to be incredible and so I would say that those are really the drivers for our business and however a gamer would like to enjoy GeForce,  we would love to welcome.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt Ramsay,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst    [66]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, thank you very much. Jen-Hsun, you had mentioned, I think, earlier in the call in response to a question that obviously you guys are not fully penetrated in gaming with the eSports phenomenon and more broadband coming to emerging markets. Maybe you can help us understand and break down the growth between unit growth or overall growth versus upgrade sales from the current installed base. 
And I guess what I'm trying to get at is the segment, the growth between that and what's the upgrade cycle you see from someone say they bought a high-end GPU from you a year ago. What's the upgrade cycle and links and what are the real drivers that  upgrade cycle for someone that's already engaged with  you and in your install base? Thanks. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [67]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So, of course one of the most important drivers is the combination, it's the combination of really, really high production value games and our install base. Because our install base are already gamers, our install base are already  GeForce customers. When new games come out, new amazing games come out, the install base wants to upgrade their GPUs to support it.  So if you look at our install base and just take a look at our, if you will, first base the mainstream GTX. Let's take the GTX 950. 
GTX 950 Class install base represents probably less then a 25% of our install base. Another way of thinking about it is that three quarters of our installed base really needs to get upgraded so they can enjoy today's exciting AAA titles and so the installed base alone is a really exciting opportunity for our growth and that's only possible because of the amazing AAA titles. It's the Star Wars of the world that the Call of Duty of the world and the Assassin's Creed and tue Batman that really causes our install base, inspires our install base to upgrade to new GPUs. 
So that alone has really great growth opportunity, not to mention the other factors that you started with which was eSports and developing countries having broadband and then of course what we hope to be a big driver in the coming year with VR, so the install base I think is a big growth driver for us. Okay?

Yes, thank you and congratulations on good results. And a lot of this has been talked about before but just wanted to get a sense of kind of a normalized revenue growth rate, at least as much as you can discuss with some of the headwinds that you experienced this year, potentially abating next year, namely the PC OEM business, maybe might not decline as fast or at the same rate as it did this year. 
 So just wondered if you could maybe  discuss a little bit about the  -- more of a normalized growth rate. And it seems like this year you'll end up about 5% growth rate,  given the fact that PC has fallen pretty significantly.  So any color there would be helpful. Yes, I appreciate it. I think, first of all, the recognition that our PC OEM or our OEM business has largely -- the decline has abated. We're still -- we obviously still work on OEM projects and we're selective about the OEM projects. We're thoughtful about the projects we work on. And we care very much about working with our strategic partners. 
For example, some of the really amazing projects that have been announced recently, the Microsoft Surface Book. I mean, holy cow.  What a great laptop. Mine should be arriving any day now. And so, I'm super excited about that. I thought Panos and the guys over at Microsoft just did a killer job on that laptop. And it was incredibly challenging, and we love to work and we love building groundbreaking work. 
And in the other project, over at Google, with Google Pixel C, I thought it was amazing. I mean, it's just a fantastic laptop. And it's based on our latest generation Tegra. Hiroshi and the team did a great job building it, and what a fantastic new tablet model. And so, we're going to continue to work on these type of OEM projects. And so we have exciting ones that we're in the project -- in the process of working on. 
And so, my expectation is that the PC OEM business and the Tegra OEM business is going to be here. But it's just not a huge focus of ours. Our focus -- focus is not the right word. It's not where we expect our growth drivers to come from. Our major growth drivers are the four that we've talked about several times during the call. 
In terms of growth rate, I think it's going to take potentially a couple of years for us to have some kind a feeling for growth rate. Let me tell you why. In no time in the history of our Company did we have a brand new business model, right, first of all. We have a brand new business model. This new business model leverages one architecture. 
 But instead of going towards just serving OEMs, we largely engaged the vertical markets ourselves. It's a platform strategy. It's an ecosystem strategy. We engage the markets directly ourselves. So this new business model transition and the approach to this market is really working and accelerating. 
Now, because we're engaging the markets directly and we're looking at some very large markets, I mean, the autonomous driving market is going to be a large market. The accelerated datacenter market, it's going to be a large market. AI is going to be large. VR is going to be large. PC gaming is going to be large. 
 And so, we're now working -- we're now engaging large markets, and we have multiple growth drivers. And so I think that the TAM for the Company is larger than any time that we've ever enjoyed. And so, that's kind of the second thing. We have multiple growth drivers and they have large TAMs. And then finally, gosh, we're just doing really exciting and important work that will shape the future of computing. 
 I don't know that any time in the history of our Company that we're working on things like AI and VR and self-driving cars and  cloud computing all at the same time. And so, all of that leveraging one fundamental architecture, which gave us the ability to simultaneously engage these vertical markets with a very powerful singular investment behind it. 
And so, I think our business model is very different. The vertical markets we engage are very different. And I hope that, as a result, our growth will continue to surprise.

David Wong,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [71]

Thank you very much. In your gaming GPUs, do you have any estimate of what market share you currently control and how that's been trending over the last few quarters? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [72]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, David, thanks for the question. We don't really control anything. Our products are purchased by our gamers freely. And so it's not really a matter of control. And I mean that in a way that, look, we've got to earn the love and loyalty of our customers every single day. And whereby -- whereas we used to be a PC OEM company, an OEM company where that responsibility lies on our OEMs, today, that responsibility really lies with us. 
And we take it really, really seriously. We have 70 million gamers that are connected with us. We -- I hope that we add value to them on a continuous basis. And then we earn their trust and their loyalty over time. The beauty of this model, of course, it's much, much harder. It requires much, much greater understanding of the software stack, the way that you digitally connect and engage your community has to be very different than before. Obviously, the PC OEM model is simple. 
The selling motion is simple. The marketing motion is simple. Everything we do today, the selling motion is much more complicated and the marketing motion is much more complicated. But the end result is that the promise that we made to them, whether it's Quadro's ability to help you realize your imagination, to GeForce that helps you enjoy your game to the fullest, these promises we have the ability to deliver on a day-to-day basis. 
And so over time, I believe it allows us to create much deeper connections with our customers, which in business talk is stickiness, but we don't think of it that way. We think of it as earning the loyalty and the trust and hopefully, the passion of our customers. Okay?

Ian Ing,  MKM Partners - Analyst    [74]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes, thanks. A question for Colette here. Lots of interesting opportunities and investments here. I mean, could you update us in terms of where we are in terms of identifying and implementing the operating synergies? I think at the Analyst Day, you talked about some software synergies, unifying the silicon architecture. Thanks. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colette Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - EVP & CFO    [75]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for the question. Yes, I think our focus over these last several years has really been focusing around one single unified architecture and investment. That's really helped us to make the appropriate investments that we need in these four different markets that we're going after, but allowing us also to really focus on a single architecture that allows the efficiencies that we're seeing in our operating expenses. 
That is still going to be our focus as we move into the current quarter Q4 and as we move forward into FY17, as our financial performance is very important to us, and improving that financial performance in the short term. So, thanks for the recognition of noting our work on our investment portfolio and ensuring that our investments are rightsized for our top line.

Chris Rolland,  FBR & Co. - Analyst    [77]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi, guys. Let me echo my congrats on a really strong quarter here. So the current leader in ADAS, they are -- autonomous driving, I guess is where they are going with this. They're running their platform off of what's essentially like a $5 microcontroller, and they really talked down the importance of hardware. 
So Jen-Hsun, maybe if I could get your idea on what you think this hardware platform, I know the importance of software, but what this hardware platform might look like for these future generations that you're talking about? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [78]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, Chris, I appreciate that. If we can get a $5 microcontroller to drive and it's just a matter of software and driving is like one of the most complicated things we do. I think humans could be replaced in just about everything we do with a $3 microcontroller. And so, it seems unlikely. I agree that smart microcontrollers could be used to enhance smart cameras to do some -- to do a computer vision and I think that for ADAS, it is really, really good. I mean, just to be serious here. 
 I think that smart cameras, whether it's from Tier 1s or from companies in Japan, or various companies around the world, the ADAS driver -- better cruise control, to automatic braking, to lane keeping. Those things are all important things and it improves our driver experience. But autonomous driving is just a whole different thing. 
Autonomous driving, nobody's figured out. And obviously, there are several companies that we know who have real cars on the market, who are doing autonomous driving and there's no pretense. Nobody is saying that all it takes is a $5 microcontroller to make that happen. It takes a lot of computing to make that possible. 
And so, our strategy is not driver assistance. I mean, I've been consistent about that. I appreciate all of the people's work that are enhancing driver assistance, whether it's radar or ultrasonics or cameras to move driver assistance forward. Our strategy is really a computing platform for autonomous driving. And it's going to take a lot of software. 
And it's going to take a lot of software that is going to be owned by the car companies themselves and our strategy is to provide a platform by which we provide a lot of the capabilities of artificial intelligence, whereby they can embrace it, modify it, enhance it, so that they can make their personality of the driver experience in their own software long term. 
I just can't imagine how every single car company in the world will have exactly the same driver experience. The way that the car responds to you, the way that the car responds at all, is something that I believe long term, it's going to require a lot of computing. This is an area that's just far from being done and I think it's very complicated stuff. And we don't even know what we don't know yet. But the one thing that we do know, it's going to need a lot of computing horsepower; it's going to need a lot of software. 
Artificial intelligence is going to be at the core of it. And I think if we succeed in doing so, we're going to make the world a much, much better place. I mean, there are a lot of people that shouldn't drive. There are a lot of people that would love to get around, but they can't drive. And I think we're going to get people out of harm's way. Okay, so I think the work is incredibly important. It's far from being over and so there's lots to do.

Hey, thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the quarter. I just wanted to circle back on the automotive part of the business. I know you've done a lot of work with the VW Group, specifically with Audi and Porsche. I was wondering if you have seen any of the impact from the potential R&D clawbacks or any comments on what you're seeing out of Germany would be helpful? Thanks. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO    [81]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The area where we work with VW and Porsche and Audi are really about advancing the state-of-the-art in their cars. If you look at the work that we do, it's really about innovation and it's about the technology that they want to be world's first at bringing to market. 
This is a company -- this is an organization that believes the technology leadership and leaning forward, leaning into the software-defined car and leaning into the computerized car and leaning into driver autonomous driving and leaning into electric vehicles is a good thing. This is a company that is very forward thinking as everybody is very well aware of. And so, our work with them are really along those areas and if anything at all, we see quite a significant heightened desire to move the Company forward and do something great.

Well, thanks everybody for joining us today. There's several things we wanted to say. Our new business model transition approach to market is working and accelerating. We talked about our multiple growth market drivers, PC gaming, Datacenter  and Automotive are all growing nicely. 
We talked about the fact that we're working at the center of some big developments that are shaping the future of computing: AI, VR, accelerated cloud computing, and autonomous driving cars. These are really exciting things and we're doing that with one singular leveraged investment around one architecture and that allows us to bring the might of this Company and expertise that we have to help solve some of the problems that I've mentioned. NVIDIA is the world leader in visual computing and becoming more important than ever in a growing number of industries. 
Our strategy is to leverage this one core investment to four growth markets gaming, professional visualization, datacenter  and auto and is delivering results and gaining momentum.  So our goal is to balance those investments, our investment to capture the enormous opportunity ahead while maintaining a keen focus on improving near-term financial performance. Thank you all for joining us today.
