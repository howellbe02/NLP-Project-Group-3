--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good afternoon. My name is George and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the NVIDIA financial results conference call.
(Operator Instructions)
As a reminder this conference is being recorded Wednesday, February 11, 2015. I will now turn the call over to Ms. Colette Kress, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer with NVIDIA. Ms. Kress, you may begin your conference.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colette Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - EVP & CFO    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you. Good afternoon everyone, and welcome to NVIDIA's conference call for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. With us on the call today from NVIDIA is Jen-Hsun Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer.
I'd also like to introduce Arnab Chanda, who joined us last week as the Head of Investor Relations. Arnab and [Raj] will closely work to support the investment community.
I'd like to remind you today's call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's Investor Relations website. It is also being recorded. You can hear a replay by telephone until February 18, 2015.
The webcast will be available for replay up until next quarter's conference call to discuss Q1 financial results. The content of today's call is NVIDIA's property. It cannot be reproduced or transcribed without our written prior consent.
During the course of this call, we may make forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of factors that could affect our future financial results and business, please refer to the disclosure in today's earnings release, our most recent Form 10-Q, and the reports that we may file on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
All of our statements are based as of today, February 11, 2015, based on information currently available to us. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements.
During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You may find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our website.
With that, let's start.
We achieved record revenue for the fourth quarter and the full year, with impressive growth in each of our market specialized platforms. NVIDIA's strategy of creating an ecosystem in gaming, enterprise graphics, accelerated computing, and automotive continues to make excellent headway. Our gaming platforms grew more than 30% year on year and accelerated in the fourth quarter, driven by our tenth-generation Maxwell processors and the vibrant gaming market.
Launched in September, our GeForce GTX 980 and 970 GPUs continue to be enthusiastically received. The Maxwell architecture provides new capabilities, such as real-time dynamic global illumination, which simulates the true interaction of light with the environment and is the most energy-efficient GPU architecture ever created.
We added to our lineup the GTX 960, which brings Maxwell to $199, what we see as the gaming market's sweet spot. Powered by 1,024 CUDA cores, it plays even some of the most demanding titles on 60 frames per second on full HD displays. And, it leaves plenty of headroom for overclockers.
The GTX 960 will let gamers enjoy the latest games at quality and performance greater than even the best gaming consoles at half the price. There are now more than 50 million PCs with GeForce Experience, our application for the gaming ecosystem that optimizes the user settings for each title and enables players to record and share their victories.
In the month of November alone, GeForce Experience users downloaded our drivers over 30 million times. GeForce Experience brings the simplicity and the community benefits of a console to the PC.
NVIDIA powered the holiday season's two best-reviewed Android tablets: the Google Nexus 9 and our own SHIELD tablet, which are based on our Tegra K1 processor. More than a dozen media outlets recommended SHIELD in their holiday gift-giving guides. Over the course of the quarter, SHIELD, which has pioneered a premium gaming experience for tablets, became one of the very first devices to be upgraded the Google latest OS, Android 5.0 Lollipop.
The NVIDIA GRID graphics virtualization platform continues to gain momentum. More than 300 companies worldwide tested the product in recent months and experienced the benefits of GPU accelerated virtualization. They range from large institutions such as the University of Southern California, leading manufacturers such as Airbus and Lockheed Martin, and defense providers like Raytheon.
Enterprise virtualization leaders continue to deploy GRID. Just last week VMware rolled out the latest version of its vSphere virtualization software, including full support for our GRID vGPU graphics virtualization technology.
Quadro professional graphics continued to maintain market leadership. Refreshed in Q3, the lineup is now being shipped in all major OEMs. For the sixth year in a row, every film nominated for an Academy Award for special effects was made using Quadro.
Our accelerated computing platform performed very strongly. Tesla's revenue growth from a year ago exceeded 50% as HPC customers and cloud service providers continue to deploy large GPU-powered systems. These provide deep learning capabilities that help enable our amazing capabilities like voice recognition and natural language processing. Using Tesla, our customers have seen dramatic benefits in application performance, radically reducing runtimes.
During the quarter we introduced the Tesla K80 dual GPU, our new flagship Tesla offering. It provides nearly twice the performance and double the memory bandwidth of its predecessor, the Tesla K40. A single server with Tesla K80 delivers the same performance as eight servers with our old Fermi generation GPU accelerators for a range of applications.
A powerful endorsement of Tesla came just ahead of the recent Super Computing 2014 show. The US Department of Energy announced that its next generation of supercomputers would utilize Tesla GPU accelerators in conjunction with our powerful new NVIDIA NVLink high-speed interconnect technology. These systems will be deployed at Oak Ridge and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories.
They'll be at least three times faster than today's most powerful systems. These supercomputers will serve scientists across our nation in every field of science to accelerate their research for the next 20 years.
Finally, NVIDIA's automotive platforms remain on a sharp upward trajectory, registering better than 80% growth on the year. More than 7.5 million cars with our technology are now on the road, up from 4.7 million a year ago.
At CES, we announced NVIDIA DRIVE, a computing platform for next-generation advanced driver assistant systems and digital cockpits. NVIDIA DRIVE makes driving safer and more enjoyable by introducing surround-vision and auto-valet capabilities. Its cockpit computing platform includes 3D navigation systems, natural speech, and image-processing capabilities, dramatically transforming the automotive user interface.
NVIDIA DRIVE is the first car computing platform utilizing advances in deep learning. DRIVE will leverage our dramatic advances in deep learning for voice, language, and image recognition to enable surrounding and situational awareness in cars. We believe deep learning is the key enabling technology to continue advancements and autonomous driving capabilities.
At the heart of NVIDIA DRIVE is the recent announcement of Tegra X1, a 256-core super chip with over 1 teraflops of floating-point processing power, built on the same Maxwell architecture rolled out only months earlier. For high-level gaming, Tegra X1 provides the computational horsepower, computer vision, and graphic capabilities for cars that can see and learn.
Now let's take a more detailed look at the financials. Fourth-quarter revenue increased 9% year over year to a record $1.25 billion. Growth was driven by strength in gaming, data center, cloud, and auto.
Fourth-quarter revenue was up 2% sequentially, the GPU business grew 8%, helped by Maxwell GPUs and the seasonal increase in consumer PCs. Overall, Tegra processor sales decreased 33% as growth in our automotive and SHIELD devices was more than offset by lower revenue from smartphone and tablets.
Fiscal 2015 revenue grew 13% to a record $4.68 billion. In our GPU business, revenue grew 13% in Q4 from a year earlier. Revenue from our PC gaming platforms rose 38% due to the popularity of our high-end Maxwell-based GTX GPUs.
Tesla GPUs for accelerated computing increased strongly, driven by large project wins with cloud service providers. Tegra processors declined 15% in Q4 from a year ago as smartphone and tablet designs reached the end of their product lifecycle. This was partially offset by the increased revenue from auto infotainment systems, which more than doubled, and from SHIELD devices.
Moving to gross margins, GAAP gross margin was 55.9%, above our outlook for the quarter and up 70 basis points from last quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 56.2%, also above our outlook, and was up 70 basis points sequentially. Strength in margins from gaming and accelerated computing was partially offset by those from Tegra processors and certain inventory provisions for prior Tegra architectures.
For FY15, GAAP gross margin was 55.5% and non-GAAP gross margin was 55.8%. These full-year record levels were led by the strength of our high-end GPUs for gaming and accelerated computing.
GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $468 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $420 million, in line with our outlook and inclusive of legal fees associated with our litigation against Samsung and Qualcomm.
For FY15, GAAP operating expenses were $1.84 billion, and non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.66 billion. The low single-digit growth from the previous year represents discipline from our continued management of our investments in both R&D and capital expenditures to enhance return on invested capital.
The US federal R&D tax credit was reinstated for calendar 2014. For the full year, the GAAP effective tax rate was 16.5%, non-GAAP was 16.9%, incorporating the US federal R&D tax credit. For the fourth quarter, GAAP net income was $193 million, up 31%, driven by increased operating profit from strong revenue and margins.
GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.35 increased 40% from a year-ago quarter, reflecting net income growth and share repurchases. For the full year, GAAP net income was $631 million, up 43%, and GAAP earnings per diluted share were up 51% from a year earlier.
Now turning to some key balance sheet items. During the full fiscal year of 2015, we paid $186 million in cash dividends and repurchased 44.4 million shares for $814 million. As a result, we returned to shareholders $1 billion during fiscal 2015.
Since restarting our capital return program in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, we have returned approximately $2.22 billion to shareholders. This represents 111% of our cumulative free cash flow for fiscal year 2013 through 2015, reflecting the acceleration of our capital return program from cash generated in prior years. In November of 2014, we announced our ongoing commitment to deliver shareholder value through capital return with the intention to return approximately $600 million to shareholders through ongoing quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases in fiscal 2016.
Accounts receivable at the end of the quarter were $474 million, down from $563 million in the prior quarter. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $483 million, up from $408 million in the prior quarter. The sequential increase included the ramping of our new Maxwell-based GPUs and Tegra-based SOCs and SHIELD devices.
Cash flow from operating activities was $443 million, up from the $216 million in the prior quarter, reflecting higher net income and the annual payment from Intel. Free cash flow was $412 million in the fourth quarter. Depreciation and amortization expense amounted to $54 million, capital expenditures were $31 million.
Now turning to the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. We expect revenue for the first quarter of 2016 to be $1.16 billion, plus or minus 2%. Growth year over year is expected from our key platforms: gaming, data center and cloud, and automotive.
Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 56.2% and 56.5% respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. The gross margin outlook is slightly higher than our Q4 performance, driven by our gaming and accelerated computing platforms.
GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $478 million, with non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $425 million, inclusive of legal fees associated with our litigation against Samsung and Qualcomm. Excluding these legal fees, we expect to maintain our operating expense levels near Q4 levels. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 are expected to be 20%, plus or minus 1%, excluding the benefit of the US federal R&D tax credit, which expired December of 2014.
In summary, we are pleased with our record revenue for the quarter and the full year, which reflects strength across our platforms and businesses. Profitability, as measured by earnings per diluted share, increased 51% in fiscal 2015, as our revenue and gross margin growth continued to outpace our investment.
This concludes our remarks, and we will now turn it back to the operator for questions. Please be sure to limit your questions to one, with one follow-up. Operator?

Questions and Answers

(Technical difficulty) on the strong results and guidance. I guess the first question, Jen-Hsun, one for you on the Tegra side of the business. I know that can be inherently lumpy in how it operates, but can you talk about what you envision the biggest drivers in fiscal 2016 will be to get that business on a growth trajectory versus the year-over-year drop that it's currently running at?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, President & CEO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ross, first of all, thanks. Our strategy for Tegra is to focus on automotive, gaming, and wherever opportunities arise in OEMs, we surely well entertain it. But our fundamental focus is automotive and gaming. And, you already heard Colette say that our automotive business nearly doubled year over year, our gaming business is really strong, and we have some exciting things that we'd love to share with you in the near future.
Those are our two focuses for Tegra. And if you look at the opportunities that we are pursuing, in the area of automotive, obviously more and more cars are becoming computerized cars, and at CES, we announced a brand new platform called DRIVE. And DRIVE is basically a mobile super chip, a mobile supercomputer, with a ton of software on top, and it provides for three basic functionalities.
The first is a very advanced digital cockpit. You know that we are incredibly good at computer graphics, and the things that we can do in the car, with more and more displays showing up in the car, is pretty wonderful.
The second is a technology called surround vision. Beyond surround view, which is basically cameras connected around the car, surround vision not only allows you to see the images from the videos around the car, but also create a virtual environment around it, and using computer vision technology, keep your car alert of the surroundings.
And the third is using a technology called deep learning that has been revolutionized recently. And it's something that we are very much at the center of. Using deep learning, we can do voice processing, natural language processing, and understanding of imagery so that the car can be more situational and environmentally aware. All of those technologies I just described we believe will help pave the path to the self-driving car.
In the area of mobile, the gaming -- in the area of mobile gaming, the gaming market, as you know, is huge and is growing quite rapidly internationally. It's about a $70 billion business now. We know that mobile cloud is probably one of the most important disruptions in the history of computing. And yet, there's really no computer gaming architecture that serves mobile cloud very well.
And that's what SHIELD is all about, to create the platform that allows mobile cloud to bring gaming to a lot more people. And we think that by doing so, we will be able to engage a much, much larger part of the overall gaming market than just PC gaming. So our Tegra business model is about focusing on automotive and gaming.

Ross Seymore,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great, thank you. I guess as my follow-up, a bigger-picture question for the GPU side of the equation. You talked about the GeForce business being up 38% year over year, and GPUs, as an entirety, were up 13%.
Is there any color you can provide just into the size of the buckets within your GPU segment so we can get a little more granular on how we model those very disparate growth rates? Whether it's the four segments you break out in your segment definition in the CFO commentary, or any other color you give, that would be helpful. Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, President & CEO    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We serve four markets: gaming, automotive, enterprise graphics, and high-performance computing and cloud computing. Those are the four major segments that we -- four major markets that we serve.
GPUs serve gaming, enterprise graphics, and cloud. Gaming, as we said earlier, has grown, as you mentioned, 38% year over year.
Our enterprise graphics business, the workstation business, is relatively flattish. However, our enterprise virtualized graphics platform, called GRID, about doubled year over year. And our Tesla business, which is our accelerated computing business, about doubled year over year.
The PC OEM business declined. The PC OEM business represents, I would say, low-teens, maybe, approximately part of our overall business. We've been talking about its decline for some time now, and this year, again, it declined.
Obviously the PC OEM business, representing [umpteen percent] of our overall GPU business, represents a substantially lower part of its profits because the gross margins at OEMs tends to be much lower. But nonetheless, it declined year over year.
So looking at those segments, then, gaming grew, enterprise grew, cloud computing and high-performance computing grew, OEM business, PC OEM business declined from a low umpteen percent level. Okay?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shankar Iyer,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi, this is [Shankar] on behalf of Vivek. Just a follow-up on that GPU [baked-on]. Could you give color on what's the -- based on the guidance you're giving for Q1, how do the individual segments kind of play out?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, President & CEO    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure. We guided seasonally down. And of course, as usual, we will see how it turns out.
But if you look at the position of each one of our platforms, our position in gaming is very strong. The gaming market, globally, is quite robust. We are still seeing gaming growth all around the world, and the production value of games is increasing all the time. And, whenever the production value of a game increases, it requires more GPU performance.
For the very first time in history, a game console has come out that uses essentially a PC architecture and its performance is substantially higher than the average PC performance. And so, as a result, we see a lot of adoption to our higher-end GPUs, and that's good.
We also expect that the Tesla platform continues to be quite robust. We know now that GPUs are wonderful processors for massively parallel applications like deep learning. Deep learning could be used for voice recognition, natural language processing, image recognition, video tagging, all kinds of interesting applications that are made possible because of cloud computing and because there are so many sensors and images and voice being uploaded into the cloud.
That's one of the drivers for Tesla, and Tesla business has doubled, year over year, from a fairly large base now. My expectation is that this coming year, Tesla will remain on that trajectory. And, I hope that Tesla will grow very nicely this coming year.
GRID, another part of our GPU business, is all about enterprise virtualization. Because of GRID, we are now able to -- companies are able to now virtualize beyond the data center all the way to the end-user computing device. For the very first time it is now possible to virtualize graphics-intensive applications and make it possible for people to enjoy their applications wherever they are. So now you could be virtualized, it can be more secure, you can be more mobile, enjoy graphics on any device.
That platform is growing nicely. A year ago we had about 400 trials. Today, we have well over 1,000; and recently, the most -- the largest enterprise virtualization company in the world, VMware, has integrated GRID into vSphere and it has gone to production.
And so, we are seeing quite a bit of momentum from that production release. So these platforms are all growing nicely, and I expect this year to help drive our growth.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shankar Iyer,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great. So I just have a follow-up on the autos business. I know you talked about different products and features that you have been working on and those seem to be, kind of, maybe a high-end side of auto.
But can you talk about the products that you have for the mid and low end? Because, it looks like that might be the area where the scale is. And also talk about how you plan to increase the gross margin for autos business, because it looks like it is in the low-30%s, if I just back out all the numbers based on all your reported numbers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, President & CEO    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, the answer to the second question I know better than the answer to the first, so I'll just answer that one first. The way to increase our gross margins is just to continue to innovate and increase the amount of value added that we bring. And if you recall, a long time ago, a long time ago meaning about 10 years ago, NVIDIA's gross margins was 30%-some odd, and over time, we made the platform more and more software-rich. Today, our gross margins are surely much, much higher than 35%.
And so, my expectation is to do the same on the NVIDIA DRIVE platform. It is intensely software-rich. I think somebody said that, today, a car is about 10% software, but soon the car will be about 80% software, and I think that's right. I think that's right.
In the future, with electric cars, you have, obviously, still very sophisticated drivetrain and such, but the car is going to be largely a computer with software. And that's where we can add an enormous amount of value, and that's what DRIVE is all about, adding value through a very powerful processor, of course. But, most of the capabilities I described, from the digital cockpit to surround vision to deep learning, is all about software. It's all the software that runs on top of TX1, so that is number one.
Your question about high-end versus mid-range, I believe that more and more of the car's value will be delivered through software, and if you have to deliver it through software, then the processor underneath it is obviously more and more important. And, my expectation is that great computing platforms will extend well into mid-range and into the low-end part of the marketplace.
And that is a belief, and just as I believed a long time ago that the car is going to be one of our most sophisticated computers, which is obviously, at this point, coming true, my sense is that it's going to continue to go down that path. And, we are going to see a lot more computation capability inside a car. To the point where I actually believe that every car will have a good processor, the high-end cars will have many good processors.

Matt Ramsay,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think the first one, Jen-Hsun, you made some interesting comments earlier about the need for, I guess, a fully virtualized mobile gaming experience. I assume you're meaning across desktop, tablets, smartphone, cloud, et cetera.
One of the things that strikes me is, obviously there is the suit going on between yourselves and Qualcomm, Samsung, et cetera, and your market share within the mobile graphics business, when you think about smartphones, is fairly small from a hardware perspective. So, do you see that changing dramatically going forward? And if not, do you see the gaming mobile device market bifurcating from the traditional smartphone market going forward?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, President & CEO    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, Matt, thanks a lot for that question. First of all, mobile is much more than phones. Mobile is a fundamentally new way of designing computers. And, I believe that mobile will impact almost every segment of computing as we know it.
It'll impact refrigerators, that's not a phone. It will impact drones, that's not a phone. It will impact earrings, that's not a phone. It will impact watches, that's not a phone. It will impact game consoles, that is not a phone. It will impact cars, and that's not a phone.
I think mobile is going to be important in all kinds of computing devices. When I say mobile, that's what I mean. I don't mean mobile as in the mobile phone. Mobile technology is really important.
I also believe that mobile cloud, in combination, is one of the most powerful computing forces that the computer industry has ever known. Because of mobile cloud we've been able to extend the capabilities and the benefits of computing to billions of people, whereas in the PC era we were able to benefit hundreds of millions of people.
And yet, no one has yet created a game platform around mobile cloud, the technology of mobile cloud, the power of mobile cloud, the architecture of mobile cloud. So, that we can extend gaming not to tens of millions of game console users, but billions of users. I think that that's the great opportunity.
And I don't have anything to announce today, but that's what we are trying to endeavor. So I appreciate you asking that question. I think it's going to be a really big opportunity for us.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt Ramsay,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for that perspective. As a follow-up, this one for Colette, obviously you guys have done a great job in returning cash to shareholders and announced a new plan for the next fiscal year. Maybe as the last fiscal year ends, maybe you could update us on your onshore and offshore cash balances, if you could, and any perspectives on the difference in cash flow onshore and offshore? Thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colette Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - EVP & CFO    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Again, we are looking at a cash balance lower than where we ended at fiscal year 2014 due to our $1 billion return through shareholders, but also the increase in cash flow. Nothing has materially changed in terms of our cash flow from international and our cash flow in the US. So again, the majority of our cash flow tends to arrive from international overall operations.
We have about the same mix of overall US cash versus international cash, a little lower than where we ended at the end of fiscal year 2014. But we feel very confident with our overall capital return program for fiscal year 2016 and the overall cash flow prospect. So, I think we are well-aligned there.

David Wong,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Could you give us some idea of what percentage of Tegra is now automotive? And just a clarification, when you say that automotive infotainment more than doubled year over year, do you mean all automotive, is there some other segment than infotainment, or --?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, President & CEO    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Most of our automotive today is infotainment. Some of -- more people are starting to do to what Audi has done with their really amazing virtual cockpit, where infotainment and digital clusters merged into one. And, digital clusters is much harder than infotainment.
And so, with Tegra, with our automotive platform, we are able to deeply merge the two. And so, you'll see some more examples of that in the future.
But initially, it's largely infotainment, some amount of digital clusters, if that's your question. And between automotive and SHIELD, our gaming platform, that represents the vast majority of Tegra now.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Wong,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, great. And you also mentioned Tesla more than doubled from an already substantial base. Can you give us some idea of the size of Tesla today?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, President & CEO    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tesla is several hundred million dollars -- it's multiple hundred million dollars now.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Wong,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On a quarterly basis?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, President & CEO    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On an annual basis.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Wong,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, great. Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, President & CEO    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And it grew, nearly doubled year over year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Wong,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [28]

Can you guys talk a little bit about your eventual move to 20 nanometers? And, seems like you guys are saying on 28 for perhaps a bit longer than you have prior nodes. And if you are staying here for longer, is it safe to assume that you can get some gross margin uplift year over year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, President & CEO    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, let's see, we're always moving to the next node. Tegra X1, the mobile super chip that we announced at CES, is 20 nanometer. And so, we are always moving forward.
But, the equation is much more complicated than that. And, the reason for that is because we have the ability, because of the fact that we architect and innovate from architecture all the way to software, we have the ability to improve our performance and efficiency and features on all of those dimensions.
We can improve at the architectural level, using the same process; we can innovate at the design level, using the same process and same architecture. We can innovate at the process level; we can innovate at the software level. We can innovate at the algorithm level. And because we control all of that, we have the ability to move the needle forward in multiple dimensions.
And so, if you look at Maxwell, Maxwell is an unbelievable energy-efficient processor. And because of the energy efficiency of Maxwell, not only did we make all of GeForce higher performance, lower power, quieter, we were also able to take that GPU, just a few months later, and put it into a Tegra X1. And, the performance is really quite shocking.
And so, we could innovate on multiple levels as a company, that's one of the benefits. But overall, we are moving forward, all the time, in process technology.

Okay, great. And then, also at CES, love the automated driving stuff. But, I was little confused on the way that you are positioning yourself in that market, particularly you against, or either with, Mobileye.
I talked to one person, they say you are going head to head, I talked to another person, they say you are partnering. And, I talked to another person at the booth who said that you guys are really enabling third parties to go after Mobileye. So, how do we think about yourself positioning yourself in that market? Are you really going after them there?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, President & CEO    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I appreciate that question. I think it's a great question, and the answer is actually really simple. We are in two different things.
We make two different things, and so we are very complementary. Mobileye, think of it as a computer vision signal processor ISP, if you will. It's connected to the camera, and they do wonderful work in computer vision in that area.
The DRIVE platform is a computing platform. Just as a phone has an ISP as well as the application processor, in this case we are the application processor, if you will. This application processor has been designed to be incredible in the three areas that I talked about: digital cockpit, surround vision, and deep-learning based computer vision.
And so many of the customers, in fact most of the customers that I know, where there is ADAS work being done, we are both involved. And so, we are connected to many Mobileye devices, and we are delighted by that.
But even if you're able to detect images and objects, you still need to do something to process that information. And we could do it -- we could reconstruct the surround environment, we still have the drive to infotainment and the digital cluster, and of course, we could apply higher-level deep-learning algorithms to figure out what to do with the objects that you detect.
And so, I see ourselves very, very complementary, and of course, because we are a general purpose processor and it's 1 teraflops of computing, we can do a lot of things for computer vision. And that's probably where people are questioning the overlap. But from where I see it, we are very complementary.

Jen-Hsun, just want to follow up on -- in terms of the auto opportunity, just how you see your dollar content progressing, you're talking about selling modules, multiple processors, and then, more importantly, monetizing the software. And then, if you could talk about some of the timing here, I think the auto OEMs have become a little quicker. Where are you today in terms of the generation of products you're selling, Tegra 3 or K1, and when could you see some of these more advanced systems actually hitting revenue?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, President & CEO    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, I really appreciate the question. You're exactly right, the dynamics are that more and more of the value of a car is going to have to go into its computing, the hearts and soul of its computing platform. And our expectation is about a computer car, and the software capabilities we can bring to bear, over mechanical, electronic type of widgety things is going to grow substantially.
Second, the fact of the matter is you can't spend five years designing your car anymore. Consumer electronics moves way too fast. People's expectations are set by what they have in their phones.
And so, you've got to move faster, and the most progressive car companies are moving at the speed of light now. They've taken their design cycle from five to three, and I think I'm seeing them move down to two, potentially one. And so, this is going to be a brand new automotive industry.
And, the third thing that you mentioned is the content. Well, if you think about cars as a chip opportunity, and it's an application processor opportunity like an infotainment, like a smartphone, then of course it's in tens of dollars. But, I actually see the car as a multi-thousand-dollar computer opportunity.
Some are one computer, some are many computers, and we are a computer company. We are a visual computing company. We are software rich. All of the applications that I mentioned, the capabilities I mentioned, are all software, we provide the entire BSP. We're one of the few companies in the automotive industry that can provide literally end-to-end solutions.
And, that's what DRIVE is about. DRIVE is a computer platform, software and all, and we provide capabilities across the board. So, I see the car, long term, as quite a large opportunity for us, not a chip opportunity. Because, we are not a chip company anymore.

Thanks, and just for Colette quickly, on gross margin, I think you mentioned gaming as the tailwind for gross margin. Is that more a function of just Maxwell and pricing, or are you actually seeing gaming not down as much seasonally? And then, as you look out the rest of the year, how should we think of that tailwind?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colette Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - EVP & CFO    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So our gross margin guidance is just for Q1. We do see seasonal effects as we usually go from Q4 to Q1.
We believe gaming is still a driver, just due to the mix of the type that we are selling into the market. And, we've also talked about accelerated computing and cloud also as a driver of our guidance in Q1.

Good afternoon, and great job on the quarterly execution. Maxwell is driving a solid SAM expansion into the notebook market. I think you guys started to see that in Q3, with that segment up 2X, year over year.
Customer gaming mobile platforms are pretty visible during the holiday season, so I apologize if I missed this, but how much did the notebook gaming business grow for you guys in Q4? And maybe Jen-Hsun, if you can just help us quantify where the attach rates could go and how much this expands your GPU gaming opportunity?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, President & CEO    [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maxwell made it possible -- first of all, the background. Maxwell made it possible for the very first time the ability to put a high-end GPU in a laptop and deliver a desktop-quality experience. So you can now get a laptop with a GeForce in it and run AAA titles at 1080p and at quality levels and frame rates higher than the state-of-the-art game consoles. That's pretty amazing.
You can now just have a nice and thin laptop, and it's better than a game console. It's better that a game console. And so, people are quite excited about that; Maxwell made that possible.
We see the business growing well over 100% per year at the moment, simply because it's off of a small base. This has been an underserved part of the market for some time. We really welcome just about every company in the world, laptop company in the world, into this opportunity, from Asus to MSI to Gigabyte, recently even HP came into this.
And I say, even, because of course, HP is largely focused on enterprises, and yet this opportunity is so significant that their notebook business decided to jump into the GeForce platform. Of course Dell, of course Alienware, of course Razer, we are just seeing a lot of support from every notebook maker in the world. Because, this is an underserved market, if you will, and with the Maxwell energy efficiency, for the first time we are able to deliver an experience that, quite frankly, is pretty amazing.
And so where do I see the attach? I guess I don't think about attach anymore. And the reason for that is because PC OEM business is not really our focus, in the sense that it's already a low umpteen part of our business. The way we think about that business is that's really a gaming business.
And how big can it be, really is a function of how many gamers are there in the world. And I think the numbers are actually quite substantial, are really quite substantial. So, I see this as a growth opportunity for some time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Harlan Sur,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for that, Jen-Hsun. And then, Colette, nice job on your part and on the team's part on the OpEx discipline in Q4 and here in Q1. How should we think about the OpEx trajectory for the remainder of the year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colette Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - EVP & CFO    [45]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We really just are here to focus on our Q1 guidance and what we can see at this time. When we get further into the year, we will talk about the full year.
But again, we do just want to balance our Q1 with the investments that we need to make, with again, looking at the efficiencies across the org and what we can do. So, I think that's a consistent theme, and you've seen us play that out in fiscal year 2015, and our guidance for Q1 is about that same.

One question on your GRID GPUs. My impression was that you were very excited about the upcoming VMware release, and it has G8, obviously. I was just wondering if you -- does it give you better visibility in terms of upcoming deployments?
And, do you see that all the challenges that remain for the customers that were trialing GRID, they are ready to deploy that, or you see there are some missing pieces still? I just wanted to get some color on that. Thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, President & CEO    [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, with VMware's integration, we are now able to engage probably some 80% of the world's enterprises. Just about anybody who has virtualized their enterprise has done so with VMware's technology. And so, I think that this is a really big deal, and if you look at our trials, we went from about 400 last year at this time, to well over 1,000 this year at this time. Our revenues doubled. My sense is that there is no reason for that pace to slow.
And we'll see how it turns out, but I would think that my intuition would be kind of like yours, that if anything, it ought to accelerate. But there is really -- the most important thing about enterprise virtualization all the way to the client is to have deep integration with VMware, and we've done that, and they've done a great job. They've been a great partner.

As a follow-up, Jen-Hsun, you guys indicated some large project wins with cloud service provider on Tesla side. Could you give us some color on what exactly is the use case? You did talk about deep learning and image processing. Just wanted to understand a little bit if you could give us more color?
And, where exactly are you on that ramp? Is that kind of a lumpy deployment that you saw, or is that something very early in the ramp, and we could continue to see that grow?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, President & CEO    [51]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A lot of these projects are quite confidential, but I'll highlight two that have been public. Baidu announced that they built a supercomputer based on Tesla for deep learning, and it's used for natural language processing, translations in real time from language-to-language image recognition.
Another one that was public, I just saw yesterday, and this is actually quite a monumental event. The event is for the very first time, for the very first time in history, a computer is able to understand images better than humans. This is a milestone event in the development of neuronets, the development of computer vision, and it was announced by Microsoft yesterday.
The best human has the ability to detect and make errors on about 5.1% of the time, or recognize 95% of the images that they are presented. For the very first time in history, a computer is now able to recognize over 95%, better than a human. That, I think, is really quite a record. We will remember this day for a long time and look back on it. And, they also said that their deep neuronets were trained using NVIDIA GPUs. And so you could see that these are a couple of the examples and they were public about it. In the coming event, there is a GTC coming up, it is on March 15? 17, I'm sorry, March 17, our annual GPU Technology Conference. This year we are going to highlight deep learning and computer vision.
I really, really encourage people who love computer technology to come and see some of the largest computer companies and most influential computer designers in the world talk about using GPUs in these areas. It's just a huge event. And, this is going to be the largest GTC we have ever held, it's right here in San Jose, and this could be the Mecca for deep learning.

Rajvindra Gill,  Needham & Company - Analyst    [53]

Thanks, and congrats on great results as well. Could you just talk a little bit about your transition to a platform company? You definitely, over the last few years, have transformed from a component supplier to more of a platform-based business, where you're getting higher margins.
I'm just wondering where we are in that development cycle? And, how do you look at the overall business model over the next three to five years for the Company?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, President & CEO    [54]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I really appreciate the question. First of all, if you look at our Company 10 years ago, 10 years ago we were 100% PC OEMs, largely. Maybe it wasn't 100% but it was close. And now, we are less than -- we're only umpteen percent, substantially less than 20%.
And so, the Company has been transitioning to this new model with our own platforms, largely software, and they serve four vertical markets. These four vertical markets have a characteristic that really, really benefits from great visual computing technology. And those four vertical markets, as I've mentioned, is gaming, it's automotive, it's enterprise graphics, and it's high-performance computing and cloud computing.
And our PC OEM business is continuing to decline because PCs have largely become good enough and it's fragmented. Most people use their PCs for information access, for working. And some people use them for gaming, and so for those gaming markets we serve those, but for most of the generic and mainstream PCs, we've largely been out of those for some time.
And so, if you look at our business, it's now really focused on serving the these four markets with our market specialty platforms. And so, I really appreciate that. The gross margins are obviously higher because it's very software-rich.
If you extracted out the PC OEM business and just looked at those four segments, our gaming business, I think somebody mentioned, was growing at over 30%. Our automotive business has doubled. Our Tesla cloud computing business has doubled. And in enterprise computing, our GRID business has doubled year over year.
And so those value-added highly differentiated platforms are really growing nicely. And it's more than making up for the decline of our PC OEM business, which as a result, our margins also increase. And so, now you're starting to see the dynamics of the business, and it basically works like that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rajvindra Gill,  Needham & Company - Analyst    [55]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Very good, and last question for me with respect to GRID. I was wondering if you could maybe update us on the design engagements with GRID in 2014 relative to, say, 2013? And as you continue on this trajectory, can you talk a little bit about how the enterprises are beginning to realize the leverage that a cloud-based visual computing architecture enables?
And when do think -- because the installed base is very large, as you mentioned. And do you think this year will be the inflection point, or are we already past the inflection point, and you think we're going to start to see more acceleration of this cloud-based visual system?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, President & CEO    [56]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let me break that question down into a couple of pieces. One, the number of OEM platforms that we were designed into, that we were designed into, was about 50 last year, and it's almost 100 this year. About 50 this time last year, about 100 at this time. The number of trials we have, last year, was about 400, and the number of trials we have, here, is about 1,000 plus.
And the difference, and I think the difference going forward for this coming year, when we stand here and look at this coming year backwards, I believe that what we are going to see is because of our, now completed integration with both VMware and Citrix, and the fact that every single enterprise OEM has now adopted GRID, and that GRID is making its way through just about every enterprise -- every company in the world, as they get to be familiarized with them, I believe this year could be a very important year for GRID.
Now, the second question that you asked is where are some of the things that people found are benefits of GRID? And I would say that there are several. The first one, the very first one, is of course, mobility. Mobility as in the sense that you can now access your PC applications from anywhere you happen to be, on any device you happen to be on.
And so whatever device you have, all you have to do is have a browser or an application, a receiver if you will, receiver application from VMware or Citrix. And, you remote back into your PC and every graphics application is perfectly compatible, the performance is wonderful, and it's where you left off.
So one is mobility, second, for the benefit of the IT department, is security. No more digital downloads. The computer has now moved to the data center, the computer has moved to the data center where the data is, so that you don't have to move the data to the client. I think that that's going to be an utter transformational event for security.
And then the third is collaboration. Because more and more of us are working on the same data set and the data has become quite large, the ability to move the computer, if you will, to the data prevents all of us from having to download large data to our own client and become out of sync. And so, now we can collaborate on the same data set because our computers are all right there in the data center.
There are many other benefits but these are the three. I've also heard great stories. In Japan, one particular car company wanted to move all the workstations into the data center because it's dangerous to have so many heavy things in such tight environments. And during earthquakes, it's harder for them to manage all those different computers. And so, they have a mandate, push it all out into the data center.
Another one, because of flexible workforces, this is now in Europe, large car companies do a lot of outsourcing. And because they work with different tier 1s from a lot of different industries, it's hard for them to collaborate with them without having all their engineers of the tier 1s, of the subcontractors, move on-site. And so, now with GRID, they can actually have the computer be remotely accessed off-site, in a secure way without digital download of the data, and the engineers, their subcontractors, can literally be everywhere.
There are all kinds of anecdotal stuff. IT departments of colleges -- college is a perfect example, another example. They have a large number of computers, but the computer per square meter is very, very low because, as you know, that colleges are very large in campus.
And then, also, the people come and go. They only stay for a couple, two, three years, by definition. And so, in that particular case, putting all of the workstations in the data center has tremendous benefits to the IT department. So, I hope that answers your question.

Jen-Hsun, if I could first ask about the gaming business in terms of PCs. In fiscal Q4, can you talk a little bit more about, geographically, how demand was across the developed markets as well as the emerging markets?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, President & CEO    [60]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, Steven, our largest market is China. As you know, as you probably could guess, GeForce is the largest game platform in China, and the reason for that is because it's a market that historically hasn't had access to game consoles.
It's still extremely important, extremely expensive, consoles are, and of course, most of the titles are from the West, and most of the titles that people enjoy in China tends to be multi-player. It tends to be role-playing games, tends to be Internet-based games. And so, China still remains our largest market.
The fastest growing market is probably Southeast Asia. These developing countries, developing markets, excuse me, developing markets, when they get to a certain point in their computer history and Internet history, all of a sudden the gaming market booms. And in that area, Southeast Asia, we know now the economies have become sufficiently vibrant because of the outpouring of opportunities from China.
Those local regional economies have now become quite large and quite vibrant. And, we are seeing the same thing now, as we saw five years ago, in China, we're seeing the same developments in Southeast Asia.
So, I would say that Southeast Asia is probably the fourth largest region, but it's the fastest growing region by far. And then, of course the US and Europe, both quite vibrant.

Congratulations on the great quarter and year. I was wondering, Jen-Hsun, if you could update us on what is going on in the licensing front, perhaps comment on if it's getting to the point where it might provide a tailwind to gross margins this year, or if not this year, when? Thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, President & CEO    [63]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, our licensing discussions are ongoing and quite rigorous. And the thing that is, of course, very important to note is that we are unquestionably the world leader in visual computing. And we have created so much of modern computer graphics, it's almost hard to even make a list of it anymore.
Fundamentally, from the invention of the GPU to modern general-purpose computing GPUs, like CUDA and others. The type of work that we are doing is obviously pioneering, and it's very important to many markets. We're open to licensing technology to companies who would like to exercise their own design and build their differentiated products, but protecting our IP is extremely important to our Company.
We are in discussions. Of course, the most public discussion is the one with Samsung and Qualcomm. And we're looking forward to some of the developments that will be happening in just a few more months. And so, I look forward to reporting on the developments in that area in the next several quarters.

Yes, thanks, could you talk about your foundry strategy little bit? TSMC, good supplier but not considered the best FinFET out there. Would you consider diversification being something you would evaluate?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, President & CEO    [67]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well first of all, TSMC is a fabulous supplier. And number two, their FinFET technology is excellent. And, we've been evaluating it and we -- of course, we do test chips, and our test-chip technology is incredibly rigorous and we take it very, very seriously.
This comes from the years of learning that and working with advanced-process node and fast-process ramps, we take it incredibly seriously. So, we've been working with TSMC on FinFET now for a couple of years, and so we have quite a bit of confidence in their ability to deliver amazing FinFET transistors.
I guess, with respect to that, we always look to look at all foundries, and TSMC remains our most strategic, of course, and they're going to continue to be a very, very important partner for us for the foreseeable future.
