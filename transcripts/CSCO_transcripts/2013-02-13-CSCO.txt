--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Chambers,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman and CEO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mel, thank you very much.
As we exit Q2 FY '13 we continue to be pleased with the traction of our strategy, our value proposition to our customers, and the execution of our Company and our partners. We delivered another quarter of solid profitable growth with record revenue up 5% and record non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.51 up 9% year-over-year.
In my recent conversations with global business and government leaders, the tone is cautious optimism. I am not suggesting the optimism would translate into immediate GDP growth, but there is a belief we can move to a world driven by opportunity, not scarcity, and that technology will play a very large role in that opportunity. Cisco's strategy delivering integrated architectures that address the top business opportunities and the biggest market transitions is differentiating us from our peers and will help enable us to achieve our goal of becoming the number one IT company in the world.
As I translate these observations to this quarter, I have high key takeaways. First, our execution on our financial model is very solid with record revenues, earnings per share, net income, and non-GAAP operating income. Gross margins continue to be very stable. Expenses are growing in line with revenue growth and operating margins are strong.
Second, we continue to drive strong results in most of the key technology transitions. The transitions such as data center cloud virtualization, mobility and video had very solid results in the quarter in what remains a challenging economic environment. We continue to invest in the market transitions that we believe will drive our next phase of growth, notably the Internet of Everything and programmable networks where we continue to lead the market with our execution on our Cisco One portfolio.
Third, our Services business continues its solid growth in Q3(sic) up 10%. Our Services led engagements and innovation together with our partners are driving our wallet and mind share with customers.
Fourth, we continued to see a soft global recovery with Europe, and especially Southern Europe still under stress. On the positive side, we continue to see improvements of you as enterprise and US commercial orders which we believe is likely an early indicator of future GDP growth.
Finally, we generated operating cash of over $3 billion while returning almost $1.25 billion to shareholders this quarter with the dividend and the buyback. Over the last year-and-a-half, we closed 14 acquisitions totaling approximately $7 billion with 13 of the 14 adding important software, cloud, and recurring revenue assets across our portfolio. We remain very committed to our capital return strategy to drive the value to our shareholders.
In summary, we believe that our Q2 results once again demonstrate that our vision and strategy are working. In simple terms, we did what we said we would do in what I think we would all agree is a challenging market. As we continue to deliver on the innovation, quality and leadership our customers expect we are pleased with our execution.
We are managing our portfolio and operations, investing for the future, and delivering the integrated architectural solutions to become our customers most strategic IT partner. To provide additional details on our Q2 FY '13 results, I'd like to turn the call over to Frank. I would then walk through what we're seeing in the business and where we are focusing going forward. Frank will detail our guidance and we'll wrap up the call then with Q&A at the end.
Frank, over to you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Calderoni,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - EVP and CFO    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you John.
In Q2 we continued to execute on our strategy of driving profitable growth, which contributes to increasing shareholder value over the long term. At our financial analyst conference we discussed our focus on innovation, portfolio management, and operational discipline and we believe you are seeing the results from that focus. While we continue to operate in a challenging macroeconomic environment, we are pleased with the discipline and execution of the Company, with total revenue a record $12.1 billion, up 5% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.51, up 9%. Delivering our fifth straight quarter of growing earnings faster than revenues. Our non-GAAP EPS includes a $0.01 benefit related to a tax item I will discuss in more detail later.
In terms of our business momentum, we saw product revenue growth of 3% with total product book to bill of slightly less than one. With total revenue globally, we had 9% growth in the Americas, and 8% in APJC, while Europe's macroeconomic challenges continued resulting in a decrease of 5% for EMEAR. Our Services business continues to be a competitive differentiator for Cisco and this quarter we grew Services revenue 10% with consistently strong and industry-leading gross margins. We continue to manage our overall business as a portfolio, both in terms of top line growth, as well as profitability. With any portfolio there are areas of strengths, both in the technology area as well as across the regions and also areas for improvement.
The growth drivers that we laid out at our financial analyst conference continue to drive our Business. Specifically, we are seeing our Data Center, Wireless, Video, and Services business driving growth. For Data Center specifically, where we entered a different margin profile business for Cisco, I am pleased with the ability of our team to manage the levers of the Business to drive profitable growth for Cisco and for our shareholders. I'm also pleased with the performance of our core Business giving the economic challenges globally, and John will share some additional perspective on this portfolio in his section.
This quarter we both grew and divested our portfolio to improve our innovation and provide for future growth and returns. We announced a series of strategic acquisitions including Meraki, a leading provider of cloud managed networks, Cloupia, management software for automating data center infrastructure, Cariden, network planning and design, BroadHop, network policy management software, and Intucell, self optimizing network software. We also announced the sale of our Linksys product line which we expect to be accretive to our overall returns and we continued the successful integration of NDS.
Each of these actions fits within our strategy to accelerate the growth and profitability of our Business, and with each acquisition, we acquired talent and expertise in addition to intellectual property. We will continue to position Cisco for the future and drive the greatest return for our shareholders.
In terms of our gross margins, we have made substantial progress with our operational excellence initiatives where our investments are driving positive returns each quarter. We continue to focus on specific activities such as value engineering and portfolio management which have led to reasonably stable gross margins over the last two years. Our focus on profitability areas within the Company, is helping Cisco to deliver our bottom-line results.
As a result, in Q2 FY '13 our total non-GAAP gross margin was 62.3% compared to 62.7% last quarter and 62.4% a year ago. Our non-GAAP product gross margin was 60.9% compared to 61.5% last quarter and 60.9% a year ago. Our non-GAAP service gross margin was 67.6% compared to 66.9% last quarter and 68.0% in Q2 FY '12.
We also saw reasonable stability and consistency in our total gross margins by geography, with the Americas 61.8%, EMEAR at 64.9%, and APJC at 60.0%, as well as from a product area perspective. We are driving continuous improvement throughout the entire Company. We have remained disciplined with our non-GAAP operating expenses which were $4.1 billion or 34.1% as a percentage of revenue compared to 34.8% in Q1 FY '13.
We have better alignment and improved efficiencies to enable us to invest to grow our market leadership over the long term. For example, we continued to invest in the industry's best talent. Our headcount was up approximately 1,100 from last quarter with approximately 500 of the additions theme from Meraki, Cloupia, Cariden, and BroadHop, and the remainder being strategic hires in engineering, as well as services. We have been very targeted with our headcount investment, focusing on areas that we expect will drive profitable returns over time.
We demonstrated leverage in our profitability model this quarter with our strong non-GAAP operating margins at 28.2%, which was at the high end of our long-term financial model. We continued to drive cost efficiencies and productivity gains while we strengthened our innovation portfolio.
As I mentioned earlier, we did have a tax benefit this quarter that resulted in a lower than expected non-GAAP tax provision rate of 20%. The tax benefit related to the signing of the American Taxpayer Relief Act which resulted in a tax law change retroactively reinstating the Federal R&D tax credit. This had a $132 million positive impact, $72 million related to FY '12 and $60 million related to Q1 and Q2 of FY '13. Only the FY '13 portion of the benefit of $60 million is included in our non-GAAP earnings this quarter. The full $132 million benefit is included in our GAAP earnings.
Also this quarter, we settled IRS tax audits covering six years going back to fiscal year '02. The settlement resulted in a $794 million benefit that is only included in our GAAP earnings this quarter and is excluded from our non-GAAP earnings. In terms of profits, we had solid results both from a non-GAAP, as well as from a GAAP perspective. Our non-GAAP net income was $2.7 billion representing an increase of 6%, and as a percentage of revenue non-GAAP net income was 22.5%.
As I mentioned earlier, our non-GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis was $0.51 versus $0.47 in the second quarter of fiscal year 2012, a 9% increase. Again, our non-GAAP EPS included approximately $0.01 tax benefit. The net income was $3.1 billion as compared to $2.2 billion in the second quarter of fiscal year 2012. GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis were $0.59 versus $0.40 in the same quarter of fiscal year 2012.
Our commitment to our shareholders to successfully execute against our stated capital allocation strategy remains one of our top priorities. Cash flow from operations was a very strong $3.3 billion, which was up 8%. We returned $1.2 billion to our shareholders including $500 million through our share repurchases and $743 million through our quarterly dividend. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments were $46.4 billion, including $7.0 billion available in the US at the end of the quarter.
Our balance sheet performance continues to be very strong and is a competitive differentiator. The metrics were solid with DSO at 34 days, non-GAAP inventory turns of 11.1 and total deferred revenue growth of 7%.
Our results continue to demonstrate that we are executing as we said we would. We are pursuing the opportunities that we believe are strategic to our growth and delivering the innovation to accelerate our customers' priorities. Achieving profitable growth where profits grow faster than revenue long term has been our management focus. We're confident with our financial model and we believe we are in a position of strength and we remain focused on our execution.
I'll now hand the call back over to John for further detail on our business momentum, as well as our trends. John?

John Chambers,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman and CEO    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you very much Frank.
I now will provide some additional detail on the performance and trends we are seeing in our Business and in the market. I'll first walk through our portfolio in terms of year-over-year revenue growth followed by discussing geographic and customer segments in terms of orders.
First our core business. Switching revenues increased 3% this quarter with increases in both fixed and modular. We continued to see strength in our Nexus data center switching, growing more than 20%. In the campus we demonstrated our continued innovation with availability of the Catalyst 3850, the industry's first fully converged wire and wireless platform. We do see the overall switching market as relatively flat and expect continued macro and government spending challenges to remain headwinds for this segment overall. The stability of our switching gross margins continues. Gary, a real nice job by you and Frank on that.

Thanks, John.

John Chambers,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman and CEO    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our next-generation routing strategy remains solid with our architectural approach and strength in mobility and video providing differentiated long-term value. In this quarter, total revenue for next generated networks -- next-generation networking, the routing segment declined 6%. Driven by the timing of some large deals and challenging environments in a few key geographies such as Europe and China. We saw continued momentum in the edge with the ASR 9000 growing comfortably above 30% year-over-year and SP mobility strengthened by the strong ASR 5500 adoption growing again in the upper teens.
Wireless continues to be one of our fastest growing business with revenue growth of 27%, the fifth consecutive quarter of record revenue for our wireless group. With the portfolio completely refreshed, we experienced strong growth across the board, SP Wi-Fi growth continued to be extremely strong with this segment more than doubling year-over-year. Where are a few years ago we were candidly behind in wireless we have innovated and executed very well and are today in a strong market leadership position. We have driven this leadership with a combination of internal innovation and strategic investments and we will continue to be aggressive with moves like the acquisition of Meraki.
Security grew 1% driven by high-end firewall growth in data centers. We continue to win in security with an architectural play, and as such, are fundamentally shifting our strategy from a collection of products to a platform. The growth of our identity services engine managing the deluge of mobile devices and our acquisition of cognitive security providing an advanced threat defense demonstrates how we are moving our strategy forward.
Moving on to the data center, data center grew 65%, fueled by the industry leadership we're delivering with our unified data center strategy. We continue to see strong growth across all geographic regions with more than 20,000 UCS customers, up 87% year-over-year and more than 3,000 channel partners to actively billing UCS worldwide. To put this momentum in perspective, our UCS plus Nexus 2k through 5K business is at an overall $3.5 billion annual run rate. Our recent Nexus 6000 introduction is a sign of our continued innovation in this market.
Our VCE joint venture continues to lead the converged infrastructure market, with demand surpassing the $1 billion run rate. As we hit these large numbers, we continue to be very optimistic about our absolute growth, but by definition, the percentage growth as these numbers increase will slow. We will also likely see some increases in seasonality, as our peers see with much stronger calendar year Q2 and calendar year Q4 performance.
These are good challenges and speak to the leadership role we've established in this market. CIOs continue to tell us that UCS and Nexus are their primary strategy in the data center and they are increasingly evolving Cisco from a primarily a communications partner to a strategic IT partner. From the onset, we took an architectural approach to this market and that has driven unique and differentiated value. I could not be more pleased with the continued innovation, execution, momentum, and value we are driving.
Now moving on to collaboration, collaboration declined 11% year-over-year. We did see good growth in conferencing which grew 11% year-over-year with WebEx, billable users growing 40% to 8.5 million billable users. UC is flat, excluding the underlying server revenue, UCS, which is now reported in data center.
Our largest challenge continues to be in our TelePresence business with the US Federal business continuing to be the most challenging in terms of markets. Where we sell an integrated video architecture from the iPhone to the iPad to the X60, to the X90, to a mercy TelePresence, we win. Cloud mobility, BYOD and pervasive video continue to drive the transitions in this market, and I believe we have the opportunity to be the market leader.
Moving on to video, total SP video grew -- revenue was up 20% year-over-year. The integration of NDS continues to go very well, driving results on both the top and bottom line. The recent announcements of our next-generation Videoscape platform integrating the assets acquired with NDS, and market traction including major new alliances with AT&T and Cox have been very well received. We continue to drive a transition in our service provider video business driven by the integration of NDS, evolving from low margin set-top box business to more of a profitable and strategic Videoscape architecture in the cloud.
Finally our service business delivered 10% growth as we continue the transition to solutions led selling to expand our opportunity to sell integrated architectures. A key element of our strategy is this growth of smart services, where the customer uses our software and analytics to drive greater efficiency, better performance, and simplification of their networks and IT infrastructures. We saw smart services new customer growth of 81% in this quarter. We continue to deliver our services intellectual property to our customers to arm them to grow their opportunity and scale ours.
At the financial analyst conference we discussed our aspirations to grow services to 24% to 26% of our revenue. We already are approaching that level with our global enterprise accounts and seeing that traction translate into increased share of wallet, mind share and total opportunity with these customers. We are focused on scaling that model throughout the entire customer base, going hand-in-hand as we do this with our partners. In summary, we continued to drive innovation across our entire portfolio focused on architectural solutions, bringing together ASICs, hardware, software, and services to deliver differentiated customer value.
I will now move on to provide some color on our geographic and customer segments. The following geographic and customer growth rates are in terms of year-over-year product orders unless specifically stated otherwise.
In Q2 Cisco's total product orders were flat year-over-year. I would remind you that the order growth for Q1 and Q2 of last fiscal year were strong at 13% and 17%, therefore challenging comparisons. Looking at the numbers from a geographic perspective, specifically the American region grew 2%, US enterprise and US commercial continue their very positive growth trends, both up 9% year-over-year.
Within the public sector, we continue to see state, local, and education accelerating, growing across the US at 7%, and US Federal which maybe starting to stabilize, still too early to say for sure, was still negative at minus 5%. US service provider was relatively flat. As you know, the service provider sector is largely oil driven. We continue to believe our integrated architectures to address mobility, video and cloud are a huge competitive advantage.
The Asia-Pacific, Japan and China region grew orders 3%. India had another quarter with growth of over 50%, and Japan grew in the mid single digits. China was down approximately 4%. While we believe the China decline may last for several quarters, we are committed to the China market, our customers, partners, employees and the Chinese people. We are confident that our growth will return to double-digit growth if we execute properly. Our Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Russia region declined by 6%, a slight improvement from last quarter's decline of 10%. We are seeing some stabilization but still too early to call recovery across Europe.
Now moving onto the customer market view, again from an orders perspective, enterprise grew 1%, US strength was offset by weakness in EMEA which was down approximately 10% in enterprise and China. Commercial grew 1% with the US strength offset by slight weakness in other regions. Our Service Provider business declined 1%. Slight declines in the Americas and EMEA were offset by double-digit growth in Asia-Pacific, Japan, and China. As we discussed, we are driving the transition to more software video solutions and have been more selective in the business we are taking in terms of set-top boxes and the lowest margin set-top box business in particular. Global public sector was flat.
Frank, let me now turn it over to you for guidance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Calderoni,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - EVP and CFO    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, John.
Let me now provide a few comments on our guidance for the third quarter fiscal year '13. Let me remind you again that our comments include forward looking statements and you should review our recent SEC filings that identify important risk factors, and understand that actual results could materially differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements and that actual results could be above or below our guidance. The guidance we are providing is on a non-GAAP basis with a reconciliation to GAAP.
For Q3 FY '13 we expect revenue growth to be in the range of 4% to 6% on a year-over-year basis. This assumes that our divestiture of the Linksys product line, which has been approximately 1% of our product revenue closes mid quarter and will no longer be contributing to our top line.
For the third quarter, we anticipate non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately in the range of 61% to 62%. Our non-GAAP operating margin in Q3 is expected to be in the range of 26.5% to 27.5% and our non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be approximately 21% in the third quarter. Our Q3 FY '13 non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.48 to $0.50 per share and we anticipate our GAAP earnings in Q3 will be $0.08 to $0.11 per share lower than our non-GAAP EPS.
We have modeled into our guidance cautious optimism, assuming continued strength in US commercial and US enterprise, early signs of stability in parts of Europe, reacceleration in many of our top emerging countries, continued execution in our growth markets, and continued leadership with service providers. We do see some risk with the political and economic landscape in the US, Europe and Asia, but we believe our momentum supports this position. We do encourage you to be conservative in your models this quarter and next.
Other than those quantified items noted previously, there are no other significant differences between our GAAP and our non-GAAP guidance. This guidance assumes no additional acquisitions, asset impairments, restructuring, and tax or other events which may or may not be significant. As reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.
Thank you, and John, thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Chambers,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman and CEO    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you Frank, well done.
As I reflect on Q2 FY '13, I'm pleased with our execution as a Company. We continued to deliver on our commitments to you, our shareholders, to our partners, and to our customers. Each of us as Cisco employees take pride in our record revenue, with growth of 5%, non-GAAP gross margins of 62.3%, non-GAAP expense growth of 5%, $3.3 billion in cash from operations and 9% growth in non-GAAP earnings per share.
Looking forward, most of the market trends are playing to our strengths and where we have made our most important strategic investments. First in the data center, we're seeing our momentum translate into significantly increasing deal sizes and opportunities. Just as an example, a major enterprise customer after they put in their pilot systems and then moved into production did $3 million with us in the data center in one year. And just one and a half years later $35 million was their run rate. UCS is becoming a preferred platform for business-critical applications, one proof point is what we've done with our partner SAP and their Hannah on the UCS platform, where scenarios that took days are run in seconds for 30% to 35% less cost.
Second, in mobility we are seeing CapEx spend move rapidly from wireline to wireless or mobility. And Cisco has the only portfolio in the industry that brings together wireless LAN, mobile edge, mobile backhaul, small cell, and SP Wi-Fi to address the cloud and BYOD proliferations. Third, on video, NDS is helping drive our business in the cloud, moving from set-top boxes to more valuable and profitable software and service offerings. And fourth we are very well positioned to capitalize when accelerated growth returns in our top five emerging countries. We have built a strong foundation in these markets as we understand that in the long run, the majority of the world's GDP and growth in our industry will come from these emerging countries.
We manage our Business as a portfolio and believe that we are positioned very well to invest, innovate and balance risk with performance during any economic environment. This balance gives us the competitive advantage, especially during times when markets are in transition or seeing slower growth. During these times, some businesses will outperform, others will move with the trend of the market, but we have the flexibility to invest for the long-term growth and help provide a competitive return to our shareholders. This is also an important differentiator in the minds of our customers and our partners.
In our top global accounts, we are seeing the future play out as we expected. We are leading with services and integrated architectures to directly address the customers' opportunities, and as a result gaining mind share and new revenue opportunities. Our ability to deliver value through the integration of hardware, software, ASICs, and services will continue to be a competitive advantage as the scale and complexity of traffic on the internet grows. Looking out at the future transitions, three of the biggest opportunities for Cisco lie in first, our transition from the number one communications company to the number one IT company, we define again the number one IT company in terms of relevance and value to our customers and therefore profitability for our shareholders.
Second, our ability to drive the future of programmable networks, really thinking about it in terms of application centric networks, enabling the network to power a new breed of these applications, dramatically increasing the value that the network brings. And third, what we are calling the Internet of Everything market to opportunity. Our ability to connect the 99% of the people, process, data, and things not yet connected to drive new capabilities, richer experiences, and unprecedented economic opportunity. Our focus is and will remain driving returns to our shareholders and value to our customers and employees. While we cannot control the broader political and economic environments we will continue to leverage our innovation engine, our discipline focus and our customer centricity to drive our success.
Now Mel, if it's all right, let's move on to question-and-answers.

Absolutely. Thanks John.
We'll now open the floor to Q&A. We still request that analysts please ask only one question. Operator please open the floor to questions.

Amitabh Passi,  UBS - Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi, thank you, can you hear me?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Chambers,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman and CEO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, we can Amitabh, you sound very smart.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amitabh Passi,  UBS - Analyst    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John, just wanted to ask you about a few segments or end markets, in particular security, collaboration, routing, and even service provided video excluding NDS, all these segments seem to flat to down year-over-year, just trying to understand better is it simply a function of demand, pricing if you could just maybe shed some more color there

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Chambers,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman and CEO    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Todd probably about six or seven questions. Is there one specific area that you'd like me to deal with whether it's service providers or security or video?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amitabh Passi,  UBS - Analyst    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maybe security if you could just touch on that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Chambers,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman and CEO    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure, it's a great one. If you watch our security business was just up 1%. In the areas where we sell in architecture and let's use the US get accounts or the enterprise accounts or even commercial, our security business grows well. When we go through our partners on a global basis, it's a much more complex sale. So I think what you're going to see us do over the next period of one to two years is with our new leadership under Chris Young who is doing a super job we're going to move more and more to tying the security pieces together in an architectural approach. And as we moved away from specialists in an area whether it's security or video or collaboration, our general sales force Rob had to pick that up and candidly we lost a little bit of momentum in the process. So in terms of security, I think it is a complex architectural cell as we want it to be and I think you'll see us improve on that over the next one to two years.
Let me give you one more since you were so nice. On the service provider segment of the house our relationship with service providers are just excellent. It is just lumpy and just to give you war story we had one order Rob that you and I both called our local account team on come in on a Saturday at the end of Q1. If that Saturday had been booked on Monday this quarter would've grown a mid single digits. Instead the first quarter grew in mid teens and I think I might've misspoke on the call. Q1 of a year ago actually grew business by the way in terms of total bookings 13% in Q2 and fiscal year '12 grew business by 7%. I might've said 17%, so putting that into perspective.
Those comments however made on service provider are referring to Q1 of this year and Q2. We're in really good shape here and if you watch service providers spend, and as you would expect I've talked to many of the top CEOs, and our service provider customers, more and more of their dollars are moving to mobile so our ability to combined fixed and mobile uniquely together is extremely strong and our portfolio architectural tying together is unbeatable. I'm comfortable with where we are. US service provider I think will be very solid. I have a lot of confidence in Michael Glickman and the team there, and in terms of whether you're at an AT&T or Verizon, a Sprint, a Comcast, a Time Warner, we've never been stronger positioned and we are really tough on our competitors in those accounts. Nice way of saying we'll get our fair share of spend plus some.

Hey John, continuing on the service provider line with the operators in the US except for Verizon all ratcheting up their spending this year, you've got some of the cable operators as well, some improvements in China, Japan, and even Europe perhaps not worsening. How do you see that overall evolving through the year? And then second, you've got start you just brought in to sell, you only need IP access points and you've got a full on mobile operating offering, what's your view on that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Chambers,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman and CEO    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It sounds like you been talking to a couple CEOs that we've been calling on. If you watch, the service providers as a whole are moving more and more of their spending as I alluded to in the first comments more into wireless, but they want an architectural play. Their plans are and their plans are like all of our customers plans, they are going to watch to see what happens, they're going to watch to see if there's a hesitation in the economy with any government missteps which I think personally we will probably manage through, and they will balance their spending throughout the year. And as you indicated most of the service providers are reasonably optimistic on increasing their top CapEx spending this year and even those that may not, are often spending more in the areas where we're strongest which is the mobility side of the house. I'd be surprised if you don't see us get our fair share of spending in this area and more. But just using the US service provider as an example where we have a good team, it just is lumpy, and I known my team doesn't like me using those words, but we grow mid teens one quarter, flat the next, 7% the next. And so I think we will achieve the service provider CapEx spend growth plus some terms of our growth rates and I'm hard-pressed to say a competitor that has more than a product or two that comes at us architecturally, are you aware of any Rob?

Hi, how are you doing? Couple of quick ones. First of all, can you give us a sense as to how big NDS was in the quarter, or what your service provider video may have done without it? It looks as if you do compensate for an estimate of NDS that service provider video may have been a little weak but I don't know -- I don't have the exact math to do that. Also, Meraki, can you give us a sense as to how much the contribution was or due to accounting I'm guessing that maybe they didn't have much contribution, there may have been some deferred revenues. Just to understand how that impacted because your wireless is a great is a growing and good section and I just want to make sure that we had a clean number of what wireless looked like? And then from the comment on the Americas, is that getting tougher? Is that why the gross margin was down? Or is competition in America doing fine overall and we shouldn't really worry about the gross margin fluctuation in the Americas?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Chambers,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman and CEO    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All right, we'll try to hold the questions to one, so I'm going to compromise and answer two and then try to hold your peers to one in terms of the direction. In terms of service provider video, yes 20% of the business growth was from NDS. If you look at service provider video, the Americas and Asia Pacific, Japan and China actually had good growth. Europe we are walking away from low volume, very poor margin set-top box bids, so they were down dramatically, and I mean dramatically year-over-year in terms of the numbers in this quarter and candidly a little bit in last quarter too Rob if I remember right. So you're going to see us transition where it makes sense, set-top boxes where we can make it margins, and the customer is buying an architecture. If it's purely a bid that is on very poor margins we're not even going to bid and that's what you're seeing in terms of these alts.
So, actually I'm really comfortable with where we are in terms of our video strategy and service provider and this is the type of thing Gary and Rob you all are doing great with the teams and I want to give a lot of credit to Martin and Jasper in the field teams as well, that we are focused on profitability as much as we are just raw dollar growth. And I like the way this transition is playing out, so again I think this substantiates the direction in which you're seeing us move more and more in cleaner acquisitions into the cloud software recurring revenue streams et cetera. And you nailed it with Meraki. It will be a slow ramp-up because it is deferred revenues and it's off a small base so it's very small for the next couple quarters, but I really like the margin, I love the team there, really good, love the concept, but its impact this quarter and next quarter, very small, you're right on that. Next question please.

Hi, John. Just clarification the 4% to 6% revenue guidance, if I look at the trends in Linksys, would that be really 5% to 7% revenue guidance, or would you classify it as the environment as not really yet on the gas but off the brakes? And then just on the question on the cash generation which is now greater than 2X your dividend and buyback, what's the inclination for Cisco to be not only a dividend payer but also a dividend grower?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Chambers,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman and CEO    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Combination on it. Let me get the second one, you get the first one Frank, or you want to reverse them? Okay, I'll get the second one. In terms of our growth, we are completely committed to giving back as our shareholders deserve over 50% of our cash generation. We want to see what happens in the tax regulations and candidly I don't have a religious position on this, we're going to turn to our shareholders and say what do you want us to do, do you want it in share buyback or do you want it in terms of dividend. We clearly would not have started our dividend payments if we didn't over time anticipate them going longer but I think we all want to see what happens to tax policy here, and then as that becomes clearer, then we're going to turn to you, our shareholders, and ask you what you want us to do. In terms of the first question, Frank.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Calderoni,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - EVP and CFO    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark, as far as the guidance for Q3 I gave 4% to 6%, that's 4% to 6% growth off of the base from Q3 of '12. The other comment that I made as it relates to Linksys, Linksys is approximately about 1% of revenue. So it's kind of an approximate, slightly below $100 million. We're going to close that transaction most likely mid-quarter and so we will not have mostly half or more of that revenue for the back half of the quarter. So we have to kind of take that into consideration in the guidance. So that guidance assumes that we are not including that additional revenue so that will move out with the acquisition spin out and the gross would be remaining at 4% to 6%.

Hi, thank you. Hi, John. I wanted to ask on the switching business, I think you said it was up 3% year-on-year, which was a little bit better than expected, but you also made a comment about that being flattish. I just want to make sure I understand that comment, was that into next quarter or for the entirety of the year? And how would you put that in context with the 10 gig upgrade cycle that seems to be underway?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Chambers,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman and CEO    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you look at the overall market today and we're modeling for today, we obviously have our highest market share in governments, especially in US federal government, as you're aware, and we do very well in Europe enterprise. And if I'm remembering off the top of my head I think Europe enterprise was down 10% in terms of total enterprise business there. So Simona, what we're saying is in this current market, including the benefits we get some really hot products and the Nexus line with 10 gig and others was a good example, which grew well over 20%, that does balance part of our traditional business. So we're modeling switching in the short-term at flat in terms of it. Now, that doesn't mean that's where we will be a year out, but for this quarter, next quarter is going to be a little bit wavy and we're just building our model and our guidance assuming it will be flat. We do believe that as the market comes back, as hiring starts to increase, as you begin to get more balance on a global basis enterprise becomes more confident, we get federal governments around the world spending more, then that will be an entirely different scenario in terms of switching volume.

Thank you. My question is I think a favorite topic for you, it's more about the environment. The last two conference calls there was a feeling that there is, we're coming out of a slowdown, that there is a hint of recovery and you mentioned a few areas every quarter of things that might get better, are getting better. This quarter, I look at the numbers, the order numbers, and I look at your commentary, you seem to be a little bit more cautious with your commentary. How would you describe the environment? Are you are we seeing some hints of recovery? Are we seeing the end of the kind of slowdown? Is this quarter, was it better than the previous quarter or was it, or did it trend down again this quarter? I'm just trying to understand the environment across the subsectors, thanks. Tal, maybe answering it with the Company statement, then coming down very specific. Our business by month during the quarter was pretty much what we usually get each of the Q2s, Rob would have like to have seen another point or two of order growth but that would've been a very good quarter and it was in line with what we expected with that type of balance. In terms of the areas we know there's some tremendous bears out there and some of the people I respect an awful lot in the financial community that really believe we are in for economically challenging times, especially in Europe, and the US. That's not what I'm hearing from the majority of my customers. And that's not what we saw in our business.
Starting with the US, our US enterprise and commercial growing at 9% and they're both been steady upturns in terms of their direction, and candidly Rob steadied expectations for next quarter as well. It is almost always an indicator of two to four quarters out of GDP growth. And it usually does precede by two to four quarters, the numbers, both on the upturn and downturn within that. Even if Rob, if we say half of their growth is due to selling architectures and taking share of wallet spend and selling better to their business community, and candidly, growing collaboration and security if I remember in double digits, because they are architectural sales as opposed to pinpoint products, the other half has been on a steady increase as well.
The other area is Europe and I realize I'm in the vast minority on this view. Don't like at Europe as one Europe, look at it as four pieces that I alluded to earlier. We're seeing some early signs of improvement in three of the four sections in Europe. Too early to say it's a trend change, but if you watch our pipeline, you look at what's been put into the pipeline, in Germany, in northern Europe in particular, is beginning to give reasons for some good cautious optimism. I'd like to see if for at least another quarter. UK is getting its feet underneath of it pretty well. The south, it is just tough and that one we're modeling very tough for the foreseeable future. It doesn't mean they're uncertain markets where we get our fair share of market and then some, but since we are pretty broad you're going to see Southern Europe remain tough.
In terms of the economy on China, I've always been more the bull on this, and my view is that with new leadership coming into China there's no way they're going to let that market grow slower than 7% to 9% and I would've said that a year ago as well. Our issues in China are just things that we have to work that many of you are aware of, and that will take time and we will work through it in a healthy give-and-take and win-win for their Chinese people. India, it did slow down but our business went the other way. And I think what you're beginning to see is some of the government projects free up and some of the businesses there say we have to grow. Now, they obviously aren't going to grow at 50% but I think sustainable growth in double digits feels pretty good and we got a believe there in Jeff White. So it's a nice way of saying on color commentary on the things we can control and influence it's good.
I do believe that governments have the potential to trip us up here. I don't think that's going to be a trip up that lasts a long time but each time there is an issue with government and the US currently going through one and what they're going to do on the budget issues there can cause a temporary pause in the market, both in the government, but also in other accounts. But the overall part tell is if you believe that our numbers are an indicator, we're beginning to see a very slow, not as fast as any of us want, but a slow steady upturn in terms of pipeline and others. Rob, what would you add to that?

Rob Lloyd,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - EVP, Worldwide Operations    [32]

I think John, those points are all very valid, but I think the most important thing is let's watch the US enterprise and commercial market, let's see how we do in our top five emerging countries. Those are all indicators as to how we see that, those economies begin to grow and those are pretty important parts of our growth engine.

Thanks. John, actually just a follow-up almost to that question, so a few quarters in a row now that your order growth has kind of decelerated, but given your guidance maybe some stability, comps getting easier, I don't know if you care to comment on those but would you talk about some order growth acceleration in terms of broader product orders for this current quarter?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Chambers,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman and CEO    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think mathematically you have to. And if you watch, the comps are easy as you said, but put a different way, I think we're down to a new normal and now we're looking at growing off that level, so what Rob and I watch particularly is sequential growth in terms of orders. As you would expect given this quarter and this conference call Rob and I have gone not one level deep but probably four levels deep with every one of the key sales leaders in the world from India to China to Latin America to the Middle East, each of the areas. And our pipelines in all of them are slowly accelerating, not at the pace we want to see, and clearly there'll be some hits and some misses because sales teams by definition orders lumpy, but some of them will not hit their expectations. But I'd say, overall the pipelines are looking good. We are clearly modeling order growth returning to positive growth on it. It doesn't mean we will always be right but it feels pretty good and I think our inspection, Rob was pretty good when we exercised the team confidence pretty good.

Thank you. Wanted to first see John if you could clarify two comments you made to see if they are actually the same comment. You talk about service provider being lumpy, and in the prepared remarks you talked about the routing business being lumpy. I want to confirm that really what you're attributing this to is service providers being lumpy when they purchase routing. And then in terms of what I wanted to see if you could delve into was more specifically on the service provider wireless market, since it seems like that's the favorable area for CapEx and you don't provide radio base stations, if you could give us a little bit more color on your exposure to service provider wireless in terms of what products are in there, how big a contribution that is, and what kind of growth rates you're experiencing for service provider wireless? Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Chambers,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman and CEO    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Got you. More than fair. The answer is a combination of all the above. Is not uncommon for us to receive $100 million order from a service provider in a given quarter. And that might be half their orders Rob for the whole year, on it in terms of a build out. And that isn't just limited however to routing, obviously our UCS business and service providers and our data center cloud business is very good. Our hosted collaboration and communication business, good opportunity and so we're across the board on them. So while the majority of our routers, especially high end routers are sold into service provider, and it's 35% of our business, there's an awful lot of the service provider business, on the next call, Mel, I'll probably have an answer on what percentage is routing versus otherwise but I think you can almost assume that routing isn't even the majority in the service providers. In terms of the wireless side, thank you for giving me that slow pitch down the middle of the plate. It is the area we've made the furthest progress on. The wireless LAN, the hot spots if you will, on that capability grew at 27%.
The Mobile Edge, the 5500, which we are winning in vast majority Rob of jump balls, and actually, our competition is struggling in this pretty well, grew in the high teens. In terms of service provider Wi-Fi, what we saw was year-over-year growth of 100% and what we watch is more the number of account wins we have, because these start out small and grow larger. Small sales, you're going to continue to see us invest in. Our growth there is extremely good. And you begin to tie these architectures together and tie them back to backhaul in this environment and our ability to help generate revenue and video across these mobile devices, including some Videoscape and you begin to get an architecture together that no one comes close to.
This is where our relationship and our service providers is not just the strongest by a little bit, it's the strongest by a long way. And candidly, we're putting a lot of pressure on our competitors and you might say a misstep, but I think a large part is just we're executing extremely well in our plays and the value we bring is really important as service providers, almost without exception, they no longer consider these products anywhere near a commodity. And our role in each one of them is going up toward a strategic partnership including programmability, architecturally throughout the network as they become more application centric type of networks. So it's way more than routing, but you're right, routing is a segment of service provider and it tends to be lumpy. My own view is that personally service provider growth often can be better than just routing growth, so in absolute terms it's a stronger number too. Does that answer the question reasonably well?

Thanks for taking my question guys. Couple quick ones, hi John, just on EMEA gross margin, it was up a little bit and sequentially I just wonder if you can talk a little bit about that. I know services gross margins were up and products down, so was that driven by services, or any color on what's going on there. And I just wondered one of the big global currency trends right now is the Japanese Yen depreciation and I just wonder if you could talk about what the impacts might be for you guys on business if that continues to occur as it seems like the Japanese government is indicating. Thanks a lot

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Calderoni,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - EVP and CFO    [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rod, you said Europe, so we had last quarter 63.3% going to 64.9%, primarily that improvement was a much stronger mix of product and also getting back to the other question that was answered, asked earlier, Ehud had a question similar on the Americas. The opposite occurred in the Americas, so those margins went from 63.6% to 61.8%, so we had a bit more unfavorable mix which was a higher growth in data center in the US whereas in Europe we had much more favorable comparisons. It was less of a say SP video from quarter to quarter and there was more favorability looking at the switching portfolio. In both situations it was mixed but in different directions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Chambers,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman and CEO    [50]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is interesting and again I think a discipline that Gary and Rob and Frank are bringing to the Company and all of us are participating in, is there's as much focus on profitable growth as there is top line growth. And just repeating the theme and I'm going to get into trouble here, Mel, so you're going to have to look up the data as I answer this question, if I remember my data right our business in service provider, set-top boxes in Europe was off almost $100 million versus a year earlier, and it is because we passed on the deals that were not profitable. That clearly is an indication of making decisions on what is right financially and strategic for you, and if we can't establish our value and integrate architecturally within that area, then we are not going to bid. And so I think you're seeing our whole Company Gary really focus on profitability, gross margins, all this getting measured by the acting gross margins, so everything from discounts to how we build our products to how we sell value, to how we sell architectures on it. So really in a tough environment my hat's off to Chris, I think he's done an amazingly good job in a tough environment really focus on profitable business and profitable growth. And like I said, way too early to say for sure but some early signs in certain key geographies within Europe that's beginning to turn.
In terms of Japan we've got a world-class team there and very good and our view is going to be the exact opposite, we're probably going to invest incrementally in Japan. (inaudible) have done an amazingly good job on this. We've got great partners in NTT and Softbank coming out of Japan, and the stronger yen allows them candidly to buy more of our product, and as we go globally with them on selling architectures and products together it allows us to sell a lower product from it. So I don't think the strong yen will have much effect on our business at all in Japan, maybe even the reverse. Is that too simplistic?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Calderoni,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - EVP and CFO    [51]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No, John and I think we actually have done so well in winning market share across the service provider business but we still have upside amongst those major Japanese enterprise accounts. So that's where we're focusing and as we all know Japan's now turning global so we have an opportunity to work with those Japanese companies around the world.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Chambers,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman and CEO    [52]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
But it is probably one of the best examples of where we've moved from a tactical provider to a product provider to an architectural provider to the most strategic business partner. We've knocked a large number of our competitors completely off, don't have a single major franchise in Japan service providers and we intend to be aggressive and go after the same thing in enterprise where I think there is upside growth as long as we give them the resources to go after it.

However for the Cisco people listening on the team, don't get confused. We want top line growth and profitability growth and it's what we expect from each of the groups.

Thank you, just another one on the gross margin front here. It sounds like in the quarter I'm assuming that in the January quarter the data center growth had a lot to do with the decline. But if you could look out into that sequential down for April, and even beyond that, we're eliminating some low-margin set-top business, we sold Linksys, we're adding a lot of software recurring revenues business. Are those other actions and the value engineering you're doing enough to offset the move to data center? Can we start to, first of all why not up next quarter? And can we start to see those gross margins maybe moving -- starting to move up in the out quarters? Thank you

Okay so Frank, kick me whenever you want to take over on this one, if you watch staying with a common theme, I think many of you were concerned and fair question two years ago about could we maintain our gross margins with the vast majority of the market saying not a prayer, and you're going to see rapid deterioration, and it was the number one pressure on our stock was gross margins. And if you watch, what we've done is the reverse. We've gotten very good stability across the gross margin base. You are seeing this in that 61% to 62% guidance. It will go up or down by quarter based on the mix, but you are right, we are clearly modeling in continued good growth at fast -- dramatically faster in our data center business, in UCS, but remember UCS is also combined with the Nexus. I want to be careful, but UCS is little bit over half of the business, Nexus is a little bit over a third. And when you model those two together you begin to get good gross margins and that's different than our peers.
Secondly, most of our peers when they sell servers they're selling commodity products. We're not selling commodity products. We get premiums, we get architectures, we're getting standardized on. We show stronger margins there. And yes, your overall assumption is right. We are moving rapidly to software with ASICs, both of which get you better margins, 13 of the 14 acquisitions were software cloud recurring revenue streams. And recurring revenue, as one of your colleagues said earlier, the good news about it is very predictable, the bad news is when you start from a low base it takes you a while to get to a size where it really becomes material for you. But it's a nice way of saying I couldn't be more pleased with the margin stability and while it's hard to look out very far in this industry, I like the stability we are seeing and I see nothing that at the present time is making me nervous on that.

John, it goes back to what we covered back in December at the conferences, we talked about the long range model. Clearly Tim, I think you laid out the opportunities from a gross margin standpoint, clearly with the focus that we have on value engineering as well as the move to software services which will help margins. And on the other side you've got the dynamics associated with data center as well as emerging markets and then also SP video. And John covered the SP video. So I think, yes I agree with John, we feel very comfortable with stability, and that's clearly the focus that we have in the Company. But we're also kind of watching the balance as we look out the next several quarters, several years.

Yes, it's one of the things I'm most proud of. Name me one IT player who is in a market with low barriers to entry, who for two decades has consistently commanded the gross margins we had. And this is something we're world-class at doing and I'm very proud of the team doing it and it doesn't mean we always aren't capable of improving in certain areas and have to improve, but I think in a market with such lower barriers to entry our ability to maintain theses gross margins is something we're very proud of and services, Gary, is one of the best examples of it. Next question please.

John, in China, when we think about the second half of this year it sounds like the 4G LTE build is going to kick in, I'm just curious if Cisco will be back in the game in the second half of the year? Also any thoughts on Oracle and Acme Packet, and how that may change the competitive dynamic with Cisco?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Chambers,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman and CEO    [65]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure, in terms of time in China I been doing business there for 26 years now, I'm very patient that's very hard on me, because I'm not patient in anything else in my life and we always make decisions for what's the long-term decision process and make it from a position of strength in a win-win approach. And we are great partners and we will earn the confidence of the people of China, the businesses there, et cetera as we move forward. I think by the second half of this year if we execute right, as the leadership gets established here toward the end of March and as we work through some of the issues, I think you will see us in the game on many of the opportunities. And you will see us also start to be aggressive across China with Chinese partners in terms of how we go beyond just the top 10 cities, more toward the top 100 or 200 in terms of the approach.
In terms of Oracle and their move, I think what it says is at the center of every major market transition going on that I'm aware of is the network. So you are going to by definition see both our peers, our partners and our competitors say what can we do in this network and what role do we want to play. And while as it becomes more important in terms of programmability and intelligence and moving processing power and storage throughout the network, as we clearly are going to do in security, you will see our peers by definition get into it. But overall we think we've gained out pretty well what we think Oracle's doing here. Oracle's a great customer, we're a great customer of theirs. I think you'll see us more work together, occasionally a little bit of overlap, but that really is a great question I think to maybe summarize on Mel, and it would be nice to end one of these early, which you've been giving me a nudge to do.
If you watch what is occurring in the market, and this quarter was just another proof point, our strategy and vision is playing out extremely well versus what we expected. And while there is improve on most of the concerns we have are more macro and more in the area of government action than they are specific competitors or technologies. It doesn't mean we won't be challenged as we do this total play in terms of literally a portfolio play tied together. There will always be a couple of areas we have to improve on, but if you watch where we are position wise I feel very good.
If you look at key takeaway in terms of we base our optimism on, I think you all articulated very well in the questions and Rob, you added to it and clarifying on one, US enterprise and commercial, I really believe that is the key to what the US economy's going to do over time. At the present time, that feels good in our pipeline feels good. Emerging markets, they were okay this quarter. I think they, our top five grew about 8% if I remember right, but India was way up and the others were in mid single digits and China was down mid single digits. Our pipeline is starting to build there again and we'll be watching carefully to see if we can execute well on this the next one to two quarters on it.
Our strong relationship in service providers, unless you all are seeing something that I just don't, we've never been a more effective leader or a partner and never made life more miserable on our competitors, which is a lot of fun to do, and I apologize for that, than we are right now in the service provider environment. So I think we'll get our share of spend, although it will be in big deals and will continue to be lumpy up and down. If somebody is seeing something we are missing, I think we know couple areas that you do a little bit veteran but I feel very good there. We are seeing early signs of stabilization in government spending and also in probably a little bit over two thirds of Europe, I want to watch that for at least another quarter before I got really excited about it.
The major technology moves, data center cloud, the results speak for themselves. Mobility, thank you for the questions on that, it's an architectural play, feel-good. Video, I like the transition even though it at times takes away from our total revenue growth, these are the right decisions from profitability and the future' going to be made on value added on top of services and software. And I like our three big future opportunities with becoming potentially the number one IT player, the Internet of Everything, and what that connectivity plays right into our wheelhouse. And with intelligent networks, processors everywhere, ASICs everywhere, using your install base, it really opens up for application centric networks and programmability on it in terms of direction.
We're realistic on the potential challenges. We know that we're more optimistic than most of our peers on the global economy and we're basing that on what we hear from our customers where they say our business is good, but I'm concerned about the economy, but purely also our order trends and we will see if that continues. Government activity, while a lot of people get real concerned I think, it could cause a pause for a short time, but that would be all, so we're assuming that you just navigate through that pause if it does hit. And we realize also most of our industry peers are more conservative than we are and they may be right on it. But I like where we ended in up the quarter, our revenue guidance of 4% to 6%, that clearly is aggressive and continues to be aggressive versus what our industry peers who are in similar markets are saying. Gross margin, 61% to 62%, Frank I agree, and I think we're in good shape on that. The earnings per share, we are continuing to focus on that being a key element, so that's kind of how I'd summarize it, Mel, and it was a great question to end on. So with that, let me turn it back over to you Mel.
