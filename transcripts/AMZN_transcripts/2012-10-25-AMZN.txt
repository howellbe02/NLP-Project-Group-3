Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com third-quarter 2012 financial results teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded.
For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Sean Boyle. Please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sean Boyle,  Amazon.com, Inc. - VP of IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Hello and welcome to our Q3 2012 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect Management's views as of today, October 25, 2012 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.
During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measure including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2011. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom.

Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Sean. I'll begin with comments on our third-quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 8% to $3.37 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 31% to $1.06 billion. Return on investment capital was 10%, down from 17%. ROIC is trailing 12-month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 469 million shares, consistent with 469 million shares. Worldwide revenue grew 27% to $13.81 billion, or 30% excluding the $348 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection, and shipping offers.
Media revenue increased to $4.6 billion, up 11%, or 14% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $8.56 billion, up 36%, or 39% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 62% of worldwide sales up from 58%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 39%. Active customer accounts exceeded 188 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 41% of paid units.
Now I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $10.32 billion, or 74.7% of revenue compared with 76.5%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology, and content and G&A combined was $3.26 billion, or 23.6% of sales, up approximately 251 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $1.45 billion, or 10.5% of revenue compared with 10%. Tech and content was $1.08 billion, or 7.8% of revenue compared with 6.4%. Marketing was $524 million, or 3.8% of revenue compared with 3.3%.
Now I will talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments or stock-based compensation or other operating expense line items. In the North America segment, revenue grew 33% to $7.88 billion. Media revenue grew 15% to $2.22 billion. EGM revenue grew 39% to $5.06 billion, representing 64% of North America revenues up from 61%. North America segment operating income increased 102% to $291 million, a 3.7% operating margin.
In the international segment, revenue grew 20% to $5.92 billion. Adjusting for the $347 million unfavorable foreign exchange impact revenue growth was 27%. Media revenue grew 7% to $2.38 billion, or 12% excluding foreign exchange, and the EGM revenue grew 30% to $3.5 billion, or 39% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 59% of international revenues, up from 54%. International segment operating loss was $59 million, a 1% negative operating margin compared with income of $116 million.
CSOI decreased 11% to $232 million, or 1.7% of revenue, down approximately 71 basis points year over year. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI decreased to 10%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income or loss includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating loss was $28 million, or 0.2% negative operating margin compared with GAAP operating income of $79 million.
Our income tax expense was $83 million. GAAP net loss was $274 million, or $0.60 per diluted share compared with net income of $63 million and $0.14 per diluted share. The third quarter 2012 includes a loss of $169 million, $0.37 per diluted share related to our equity method share of losses reported by LivingSocial primarily attributable to its impairment charge of certain assets including goodwill. As of the end of September, the book value of our equity method investment in LivingSocial was $94 million.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash marketable securities decreased $1.08 billion year over year to $5.25 billion. Inventory increased 34% to $5.07 billion and inventory turns were 9.7 down from 10.8 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in stock levels, and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 28% to $8.37 billion and accounts payable days increased to 75 from 72 in the prior year. Our Q3 2012 capital expenditures was $716 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in supportive continued business growth consisting of investments in technology infrastructure including Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date in what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by factors including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuation, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to actually predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling inter-company balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, or settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q4, 2012, we expect net sales of between $20.25 billion and $22.75 billion, or growth of between 16% and 31%. This guidance anticipates approximately 45 basis points of unfavorable impact on foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss to be between $490 million loss and $310 million income compared to $260 million income in the prior year. This includes approximately $290 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income or loss which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between a $200 million loss and $600 million income, compared to $462 million income in the prior-year period.
We expect capital expenditures for ongoing operations including capitalized software development to be approximately $0.9 billion to $1.0 billion. These anticipated investments are driven primarily by our expectations of continued business growth consisting of investments in technology infrastructure including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. We expect additional capital expenditures of approximately $1.4 billion related to the purchase of our currently leased corporate office space, as well as property for development of additional corporate office space located in Seattle, Washington. We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection, and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks, and with that Sean let's move to questions.

Questions and Answers

    Thank you, at this time we will now open up the call for questions.

Scott Devitt,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Tom, first on international margin, I know some of that actually is affected by currency and I was wondering if you could speak to the effect of currency that it's having on margin? And then secondly what else is driving that down, I would anticipate China investment, digital in Italy and Spain being contributors there. And then secondly, on shipping revenue up 44% year over year, I was wondering if you could break that down between shipping revenue or more Prime versus the change in the revenue allocation of FBA? Thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    To take the first part of your question, Scott. As it relates to operating profit in international, you have the big pieces correct. The first one is we're investing certainly very heavily capacity as you're seeing that both fulfillment and infrastructure capacity that's impacting our results there. In addition to that, we're investing in a number of new geographies. We've talked about Italy and Spain over the last several calls, those are certainly having an impact. We're very excited about the opportunity that we have there but certainly those are investments right now. China as you also mentioned is great long-term opportunity for us but it's certainly an investment and it is impacting that number.
In addition, one that I don't think you did mention was video content for international. We're investing heavily in video content through our subsidiary LOVEFiLM through Europe. So those are the things that are the primary drivers of what you're seeing in operating income in international.
In terms of shipping revenue, there's not a lot I can help you with there. There's a number of factors that go into that number. If you take a look at both the shipping revenue and then the resulting net shipping cost, if you will, the net shipping cost is getting a little bit better over time as we get closer and closer to customers with our FC footprint. So those are some of the things, but again a lot of dynamics that are certainly impacting that shipping revenue number.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Mahaney,  Citigroup - Analyst    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Any comments on the paid unit growth deceleration that seemed to have been relatively significant, anything about the comp or any read into that? And secondly, given all the infrastructure investments you've made, Tom you just mentioned the shipping efficiencies, we're also seeing fulfillment as a percentage of revenue start narrowing a little bit. Do you think you've reached a bit of a cyclical -- investment cyclical tipping point or am I over-reading into just one quarter? Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In terms of the paid unit growth question, it was 39%. As you mentioned it was a deceleration from last quarter. Keep in mind still the 39% growth is still growing at a faster rate than revenue, one. Two, if you take a look at last year's unit growth in Q3 the 53% that we had, that was the second-highest quarter that we've had in growth rate in last 10 years, so we're overlapping a very strong growth last quarter.
In terms of fulfillment expense, certainly as we've talked about over the past few years, stepping up very heavily in 2010, 2011, and 2012, from a fulfillment standpoint. We've just seen unprecedented growth and we've added a lot of capacity. In terms of where it will level off, we'll have to wait and see.
Right now we're still experiencing very strong growth with 30% growth on a local currency basis, 39% unit growth. So we're going to continue to invest where we need to and the fulfillment capacity we do have we're going to make sure that we operate as efficiently as we can and get more efficient with that capacity over time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I had a question about pop-up stores. It seems like a lot of people are jumping on the bandwagon there and we've been hearing stuff recently about Amazon trying to leverage those as a way to get closer to customers and help facilitate shipping for the holiday season, and just wondering if you could share with us your strategy there?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Could you elaborate on what you're referring to, I'm sorry?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Heather Bellini,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A pop-up store meaning something that might only be open for between say Black Friday and January 1, a short-term store.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The vast majority, the highest percentage of our revenue is certainly coming from our online sales. We do, in the case of Kindle, are using physical world retailers as well, which we're very happy to do so. But again it's not really a driver of our business.

Douglas Anmuth,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thanks for taking my question. Tom, it's been nearly a year since you launched the first Fire devices and I was hoping you could give us a sense of how that cohort of users might be tracking in terms of their buyer activity and in particular how you're seeing them if they're over indexing in terms of media content, consumption, Prime usage and overall purchasing, and how do you feel about that strategy now as you continue to tie Prime into devices? Thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Maybe the best way to describe it would be certainly we're seeing customers certainly purchasing a lot of content. We like the idea of selling our Kindle Fires and then being rewarded through purchases of content going forward. All that being said, even though we're rewarded with those sales, customers realize we're going to make sure that we work on behalf of them to make sure that content is not only very wide, but also at great prices and so we continue to work to make sure that we can provide that on customers behalf.
But we're seeing very good shopping patterns on all types of content with the selection that we have. We're seeing customers not only purchase content, we're seeing customers, Prime customers, certainly being active in watching free content as well and that's working very well. So it's a great combination of things that are going on there and engagement with the device.

Youssef Squali,  Cantor Fitzgerald - Analyst    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I actually want to follow up on that question that was just asked. So intuitively it makes a lot of sense what it is that you're doing. But can you maybe just speak to the effectiveness of selling the device or all these devices near breakeven. Is there any metric that you can point to to help us understand the lift you get either in terms of the frequency or of buying or lift in average transaction value or anything that could help us gauge from the outside the success of that strategy?
And then second, maybe if you could just speak to the thinking behind your content cost related to your streaming service going forward, just how should we be thinking about it? Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    There's not a lot of specifics I can give you on a per device basis from a content standpoint in terms of what purchasing patterns have been. But as I mentioned in the previous question, certainly customers are engaged in a device, they are purchasing content, they are also in the case of video they're purchasing content as well as watching free content. In the case of books, they're purchasing books as well if they're Prime members, they're participating in free content.
So those are things that are going very well. We like what they see there which is why we continue to invest in that business which is why you see the offerings, the very compelling offerings that we have out there right now. So those are things that you should expect us to do more of.
In terms of the content spend, if you're referring to the related to Prime Instant Video I think is probably what you're referring to, we have added a lot of content. We like what we see so far. We'll continue to monitor it very carefully. You should expect us to add more content going forward.
We launched Prime some number of years ago now and we had a little over 1 million items at launch. We then expanded that dramatically with many physical items. We're now offering digital items through Prime as well as most notably and certainly in books and video and we're monitoring the performance very closely. But again so far we're seeing great new subscribers coming out of these efforts and we like what we see so far.

Brian Pitz,  Jefferies & Co. - Analyst    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thanks. I know it's still early, but have you seen noticeable impact from sales in states like California where they just started lightening you guys up on collecting sales tax?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    You're right, it is early. The only thing I can point to is we collect and over either sales tax or its equivalent value added tax, we collect. And over 50% of revenue today, we have very good businesses in those states and geographies that we do that in. So that's all I can point to today.

    Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stephen Ju,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Revisiting the capacity and infrastructure question overseas, anything you can share in terms of the operating environment and what is required to get the package to the customer? Over the longer term, are there any particular regions that you think may never reach the efficiency levels you may currently see in your older geographies? Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Actually, we feel very good about the investments we're making in fulfillment capacity. When I think about the types of investments that we're making in terms of the predictability certainly I would consider the fulfillment capacity to be more of the running of the business type investments. We have a lot of experience starting up new facilities, operating those efficiently. And to the point where as you know we've extended that not only to offer that service for our retail business, we also offer that to sellers through Fulfilled by Amazon. So those are things that we feel -- certainly those investments we feel good about.
But what we are seeing is certainly just a very large ramp that we've done starting in 2010 through now. And it's one of these investments we only make those investments where we absolutely need to. But in terms of the deploying that capital and those resources, we feel very good about it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Nowak,  Nomura Securities Intl - Analyst    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Can you talk to what you saw throughout Europe? Did you see any weakening in the European markets throughout the quarter, and if so, any comments on specific pockets or countries of weakness? And then secondly, could you talk a little bit about social and your use of social networks like Pinterest. Do you feel comfortable working with other social networks to drive business to Amazon as you are now or do you think over the long term or time you like to have more end-to-end control over social eCommerce? Thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In terms of the Europe piece, we're not breaking out any specific countries in terms of growth. But as you can see from the results, we grew 27% in international in local currency basis which includes obviously our footprint in Europe as well as China and Japan. So we feel the growth has been in the high 20s to low 30s over the past several quarters. Certainly we're reading the same thing that you're reading in terms of the softness. Hard to tell how much that's impacting us. When you look at 27% growth rates still think that's pretty solid in the environment, but hard to tell how much we're impacted by that.
In terms of social, we're certainly very looking at a lot of different ways to reach customers and certainly that's an opportunity for us and something that our, certainly our advertising and marketing teams are very conscious of and working on ways to best monetize those channels.

    Ross Sandler of Deutsche Bank.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ross Sandler,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    You guys are hiring in Brazil for local content relationships for Kindle and some warehouse personnel. How important do you view that market in terms of the retail business? When do you think you could be in Brazil with a retail presence? And then fulfillment as a percent of gross profit showed year-on-year leverage for the first time in three years. Do you feel like you turned the corner on some of the capacity improvements? Or given the pace of new facilities that you're putting in, is there any reason why that would reverse back down again from here?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In terms of the first question, we have a longstanding practice of not talking about what we might or might not do. Certainly Brazil is an interesting geography as well as there are others. And we certainly export to Brazil today, but beyond that there's not a lot to talk to. In terms of fulfillment, you are seeing a little bit of leverage in Q3 versus what we've seen in the past few years. Again it's one quarter. I wouldn't read too much into that at this stage.
But certainly we feel good about the footprint that we have. We feel good about a lot of the capacity that we've added since 2010. Some of that capacity going back is getting more productive than it had been. The challenging part is obviously we're layering on a sizable number of FCs this year on top of that that you're seeing the cost for. So there's again the 19 that we've announce the date.

Mark Miller,  William Blair & Company - Analyst    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Could you share what you've learned with the add-on program and the purchase rate you're seeing? And do you think over time you can have a meaningful expansion of smaller ticket items and can that affect the percent of orders that have multiple items in the shipment?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In terms of add-ons, our goal is to try to make products available to customers that we weren't able to make available to before. And so it's very early. But it's just one additional way that we can add selection for customers and be able to get it to customers profitably. So again there's not much more to it than that.

    When you look into your holiday -- as you might go into the holiday season with your third-party inventory last year hitting a bump with video games as well as some of the Thailand floods, was wondering what type of steps you guys are doing to better prepare yourselves for a holiday season -- this upcoming holiday season? And the second question is wondering how we should think about the increasing cost shipping cost leverage as you go into 2013 with your distribution centers much closer and a higher percentage of FBA units? Thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In terms of holiday readiness, we feel very good. As you can see from our inventory at the end of Q3, it's started. We're adding inventory getting ready for the holiday season that will happen throughout Q4. We're continually trying to increase our in-stock levels, so you are certainly seeing some of that already in the numbers. And we're very excited about the getting ready for a great holiday season and that's with our own retail inventory. Certainly we have sellers who are selling on our platform. We'll be doing the same thing. And we're getting forward to have a great experience for customers during Q4.
In terms of shipping cost leverage, I think there's a great opportunity over a longer period of time. In terms of providing what that would happen from a short-term leverage standpoint be premature to do that at this stage. But we can check in future periods and talk more about that.

    On the North America media segment, just a modest deceleration. I would imagine that digital content sales and download to rent probably grew much faster than the growth rate of that segment. And so I'm just wondering if there's anything specifically that you can call out that was weighing that growth rate down in that segment, whether it's physical, media or otherwise? Thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Szkutak,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    You've characterized it correctly. Digital content is growing very fast and it's reflected in the number that you see there. Beyond that, there's not a lot of call-outs with the exception of if you look back over the past five quarters certainly the highest growth we've had would be Q3 of 2011 which we're lapping, so that's the other factor. But very good growth on the digital media side. Also keep in mind that the growth of digital will also trail our device sales and given the new launches that we've had recently, that's-- that'll be good for digital content sales going forward.

    Tom, last quarter you made a comment that same-day delivery on a wide scale wasn't a goal. And since then I've got more anecdotal evidence of people getting a lot of same-day delivery, especially here in New York. There was some news from Wal-Mart that they were going to start shipping from their stores. Could you give us any updated thoughts or philosophy you might have around what's an appropriate amount of time to strive for to deliver to people?
And then as a quick follow up to that, it seems like every quarter you're guiding to 1% operating margins and just wondering if that a philosophical way that you're managing the business, is there an infinite number of things that you guys could spend on if you wanted to and we should expect this level going forward? Thanks.

    In terms of same-day delivery or delivery speed, we have a tremendous amount of selection. And what I was referring to last time was I talked about with a large amount of selection broadly, that that's certainly challenging to do same-day everywhere; it's certainly a challenge from an economic standpoint.
That being said, if you look back over the past several years, we have added a lot of capacity. We have large FCs that are closer and closer to customers, that has helped improve our delivery speed to customers. And programs like Prime specifically has helped us get closer and closer to customers from a delivery speed standpoint.
What I would expect moving forward would be more of the same. We're going to continue to improve the customer experience in every possible way we can which includes getting closer to customers from a shipping standpoint, and we feel good about that. And again you've seen improvements in the past year and in the past several years and New York is one of those examples where you're seeing certainly shipments going in same-day in cases.

    Thinking about this investment cycle, it's been two years and a quarter and yet revenue's decelerating a little bit and free cash flow and margin trends continue to be down year over year. Can you talk about what you're seeing on the returns on the investments you've been making over the last two years? As far as return on investment capital, is the profile of your returns changing over time as you think about history? When can we start seeing returns on this as far as revenues improving or some of the financial ratios starting to turn? Can you give us any thoughts on how you're thinking about that?
And then just a financial question, US revenues for other were up 63% and then international was plus 15% for other and I think the difference is AWS. Is there any other big differences between the two geographies that we should think about? Thank you.

    In terms of return on invested capital beyond the total numbers, there's not any specifics that I can point to right now. But what I can tell you is in terms of our profile, if you think about the parts of our business, the retail business I feel very good.
We have a lot of experience in terms of getting great returns for share owners. We feel it's something that we have again a lot of experience in as we've added new categories in particular geographies. Oftentimes we've already launched those in other geographies so we're able to learn from the experiences that we've had to date, so we feel good about those.
We have a great portion of our businesses and our media businesses converting to digital, so we've talked a lot about that and feel very good about the opportunity that we have there both in terms of making great devices as well as integrating content into those devices. So we feel good about that business and it's growing very fast.
In terms of our Web Services business, if you start with the core operation of that business, we've been in that part of the business serving Amazon the customer since inception. We've added a lot of new services that have helped both Amazon internally as well as external customers. We like the characteristics of the potential ROIC potential of that business as well. Our third-party business continues to grow on our consumer business dramatically and we like the ROIC potential of those.
We're investing in a lot of new geographies. A few in the last couple of years and on top of that China. China, you should think about that one as more of a long-term opportunity. Something that we've been investing in for several years, you shouldn't be expecting high returns in invested capital in the short run in that geography, but very exciting from a long-term perspective.
Italy and Spain, we're in investment mode in those geographies, but again those are more in line with some of the other geographies we're in in terms of time line for returns and feel very good about those. So hopefully that gives you some picture of a little bit of the landscape and how we're thinking about ROICs.
