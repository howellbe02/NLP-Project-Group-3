Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Good day, everyone. Welcome to the Google Inc Q1 2014 earnings call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time I'd like to turn the conference over to Jane Penner, Director of IR. Please go ahead. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jane Penner,  Google Inc - Director of IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Google's first-quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With us are Patrick Pichette, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Nikesh Arora, Senior Vice President and Chief Business Officer. 
Also as you know, we distribute our earnings release through our investor relations website located at investor.google.com. Please refer to our IR website for our earnings releases as well as the supplementary slides that accompany the call. You can also visit our Google+ Investor Relations page for latest Company news and updates. Please check it out. 
This call is being webcast cast from investor.google.com. A replay of the call will be available on our website later today. 
Now, let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking including, statements regarding Google's future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please note that these forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation and we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Please refer to our SEC filings for more detailed descriptions of the risk factors that may affect our results. 
Please note that certain financial measures that we use on this call such as operating income and operating margin are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude charges related to stock-based compensation and restructuring. We've also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capital expenditures, which we refer to as free cash flow. Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Patrick. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on our first-quarter 2014 earnings call. 
Before we jump into my usual remarks, I'd like to bring two points to everybody's attention. First, a reminder that on April 2, we issued our Class C stock dividend. With twice as many shares outstanding, our usual per share information will look quite different starting this quarter. 
Also, second, and also as a reminder, our expected sale of the Motorola Mobile business to Lenovo triggered discontinued operations accounting treatment, which means Motorola's quarterly results are shown separately from Google's net income. You'll see this new presentation in our financials, starting this quarter. So, with these two caveats noted, let's dive into the details of Google's financial performance in Q1. 
Our gross, total consolidated revenue grew a healthy 19% year over year to $15.4 billion, and it was down 2% quarter over quarter. Without currency fluctuations, our gross total consolidated revenue growth would in fact have been 21% year over year. Google Site's revenue was up 21% year over year to $10.5 billion and was down 1% quarter over quarter, driven by the strength in our core search advertising business. 
Network revenue was up 4% year over year at $3.4 billion and was down 4% quarter over quarter, driven by improved year-over-year growth from our Ad Exchange and AdMob businesses. Finally, Google's Other revenue grew 48% year over year to $1.6 billion and was down 6% quarter over quarter. Digital sales of apps and content in our Play store drove year-over-year growth. Chromecast sales were also strong. 
Our global aggregate paid click growth was strong this quarter again, up 26% year over year and down just 1% quarter over quarter. Our aggregate cost per click was down 9% year over year and flat quarter over quarter. Currency fluctuations had a minimal impact on Q1 CPC growth. 
Our monetization metrics continued to be impacted by a number of factors discussed on previous calls, including geographic mix, device mix, property mix as well as products and policy changes. And, to help investors better understand the complex dynamics of these monetization metrics, we'll begin disclosing paid clicks and CPC growth by property in Q2. To be clear this means that we'll disclose CPC and paid click growth rates for both our Sites and Network businesses. We will continue to disclose, obviously, the aggregate growth rates for CPC and paid clicks. 
Turning to the geographic performance, we saw strong performance in the US and rest of world, solid performance in the UK. In our earnings slides, which you can find in Investor Relations website, you'll that see we've broken down our revenue by US, UK, and rest of world to show the impact of FX and the benefits from our hedging programs, so please refer to those slides for the exact calculation. 
US revenue was up 14% year over year to $6.7 billion. The UK was up 14% year over year to $1.6 billion, and in fixed FX terms it grew 11% year over year. Our non-US revenue, excluding the UK, was up 25% year over year to $7.2 billion. This accounted for 47% of our total revenue, which includes a $8 million benefit from our hedging program. In fixed FX terms, the rest of world grew, in fact, 30% year over year. 
Let me now turn to expenses. Traffic acquisition costs were $3.2 billion or 23% of total advertising revenue. Our non-GAAP other costs of revenue was $2.6 billion in Q1 excluding our stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $4.6 billion, again excluding stock-based compensation. As a result, our non-GAAP operating profit was $5 billion and our non-GAAP operating margins were 32% in Q1. 
Just a quick word on a few items that may have created noise in our operating expenses this quarter. We had some discrete legal expenses that hit our G&A line, as well as one-time M&A related costs that increased our operating expenses, particularly in R&D. So, absent these discrete items, our expenses continue to demonstrate the same, disciplined agenda we've always had. 
Headcount was up, roughly 2,100 people in Q1. In total, we ended the quarter with approximately 50,000 full-time employees. Please note that the headcount still includes approximately 3,700 full-time employees from the Motorola business as well as the employees from the acquisition completed in this quarter. 
Our effective tax rate was 18% in Q1 and our tax rate this quarter was impacted, obviously, by the federal R&D credits, which expired in 2013. 
Let me now turn to cash management. Other income and expense was $357 million for the quarter. Realized gains on investments and interest income offset the continued impact of expenses from our FX-hedging program. For more details on OI& E please refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR website. 
We continue to be happy with our strong operating cash flow at $4.4 billion. CapEx for the quarter was $2.3 billion. This quarter, again, the majority of CapEx was related to data center construction, production equipment, and real estate purchases. As I mentioned last quarter during my remarks, we continue to invest in the long term and our infrastructure continues to be a key strategic area of investment for us. Our free cash flow was $2 billion for Q1. 
Before I close, I want to give a brief update on Motorola. Motorola had a great quarter in Q1 with the Moto G showing strong sales momentum, especially in emerging markets. The team continues to be hard at work and we look forward to seeing them join up with Lenovo soon. 
So there you have it, strong results and an optimism that provides us the confidence to fund strategic growth opportunities, including Android, Chrome, YouTube, enterprise just to name a few. 
Now, I'll let Nikesh, in fact, cover more details of our business performance in the quarter. After his remarks, we'll open up the phone lines for questions. Here you go, Nikesh. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nikesh Arora,  Google Inc - SVP & Chief Business Officer    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you, Patrick. You're welcome to cover more details if you'd like. 
Our business is growing well, with $15.4 billion in gross revenue. We had a particularly good advertising performance in the United States, highlighted by a very strong auto sector showing around the Super Bowl. We had strong Play growth in Asia and we had a few isolated drags. 
By now you're aware of the four areas driving our business. The first one, direct response, or as I like to call it performance marketing. The second one, helping clients build their brand. Third, our ad tech platform to publish certain agencies. Fourth, our emerging businesses like digital content, enterprise an hardware. Let me give you an update on all of those and talk about industry trends that are driving the investments we are making. 
On performance advertising, people now always online, and they want a seamless, easy experience as they move from screen to screen. This constant connectivity is diving our investments here. As people use search to navigate their world, Google is really well positioned to help people navigate between web, apps and the places around them. They help marketeers measure the entire customer's journey and to drive better monetization. 
Next week, we'll be welcoming hundreds of advertisers to our AdWords Performance Forum where we will talk more about our work in this area for marketeers. Clients are already benefiting from our recent investments, like enhanced campaign and estimated total conversions. For instance, Shutterfly recently began measuring cross-device conversions in AdWords to understand sales that start in one device and end on another. As a result, they saw a 60% increase in mobile conversions for non-brand terms leading them to include 100% of the keywords on mobile devices. 
We're seeing great momentum in product listing ads as well, with the new shopping campaign system. International retailer, Farfetch upgraded its shopping campaigns and increased their conversion rate by 13% while reducing their cost per acquisition, or CPA, by 20%. Domino's Pizza, who doesn't like pizza, recently made it easier for customers to pay with Google Wallet Instant Buy on their Android app. 
Moving on to brand building. For years you've all seen the rise of digital video, over-the-top networks, connected screens, streaming devises and high-quality digital programming. Already, for example, YouTube reaches more than 1 billion people a month through hugely popular channels like Fashion Guru, Bethany Mota, cooking maven Rosanna Pansino, and the cult hit Nerdist. For marketeers this is an irresistible trend, and we're not significant industry moment. Marketeers and agencies that have historically built their brand on TV are reorienting their creative planning and investments [potential] at the center. 
This year, nearly all Super Bowl advertisers turned to YouTube to extend the life and reach of their TV spots. Super Bowl related ads on YouTube have been viewed over 300 million times. That's roughly three times the size of the audience that watched the ads on TV. 
In Australia, we worked with Nissan to create made-for-YouTube video for the launch of their new Patrol SUV. The campaign, which  was promoted by TrueView ads and a YouTube mast head, drove a 340% increase in daily visits to their website and more than 2% of those were interactive with the campaign to test drive. 
In a few weeks, in New York, at our annual BrandCast upfront event, we'll focus on our new Google Preferred offering. This features exclusive access to the best, most engaging content on YouTube, with guaranteed audiences through third-party measurement providers Nielsen and comScore. We're really excited about this and we're looking forward to the results of that upfront BrandCast event. 
We're also helping brands through our newest display ad formats. We recently teamed with Tory Burch to bring her New York fashion week show to a global audience across our Display network. They also did the first-ever live stream of fashion show in an ad, using our Lightbox Ads, and were able to share the exclusive event of more than seven million of their biggest fans. 
Third, moving to our ad technologies and platforms. Our programmatic ad technologies are continued to see great momentum with premium publisher partners like the Local Media Consortium, that's comprised more than 800 daily newspapers and 200 local broadcast stations as well as timing. Both of them signed on with us in February to create priority exchanges. This maximizes the value of their ad space for a hand-picked premium environment. 
One thing we know is that agencies and publishers want to trust the environment in which they're transacting. Our ad network and exchanges are widely regarded across industry as having the best quality controls, and we continue to invest here. In February, we acquired wellium fraud fighter Spider.io and thousands of our clients are already using our MRC accredited active view technology to buy high-quality viewable ad impressions. 
Let me switch over to our emerging new businesses, digital content, hardware and enterprise. Google Play continues to be the thriving hub of our digital content business. This quarter we introduced Google Play Movies to 39 new countries, so now people in more than 65 countries can enjoy movies through Play. 
We also teamed up with Sonos to bring high fidelity Play Music into the home, and we introduced new developer tools for Google Play Games, including game gifting and iOS multi-player support. 
Over 75 million new users joined Google Play Games the last six months. All of this is helping turn developers around the world into full-fledged businesses. In fact, we paid out more than four times as much money to developers in 2013 compared to 2012. 
Following the Open Automotive Alliance that we announced with partners in January, designed to bring Android to the car. In March, we announced Android Wear, a project that extends Android to wearables. We're also already working with several consumer electronics manufactures, chip makers and fashion brands and can't wait to see what developers come up with for your wrist. 
We also continue to see strong momentum from our suite of hardware products. Our $35 Chromecast is a real hit. Last month we brought Chromecast to 11 more countries. We also recently opened up Chromecast to developers, and in just a few weeks more than 3,000 developers worldwide signed up to bring their apps and websites to the platform. 
Turning over to enterprise. We continue to see strong product adoption around the globe. We launched Chromebox for meetings, which makes it easy for any company to have high-definition video meetings through the power of Google+ Hangouts and Google Apps. 
We're also investing significantly in the Google Cloud platform and have seen a very positive response to our most recent product announcement. We expect to see continued momentum in this area and we believe we can bring significant value to the many companies adopting public clouds because of our experience in building and operating one of the world's largest cloud computing environments for over a decade. 
We're able to pass on the savings that come from lower digital storage costs to our customers through highly competitive pricing. In addition, every day, more businesses, governments and schools start using Google Apps to work better together, including the State of Sao Palo, who moved to Google Apps for more than 4 million students and 300,000 teachers and staff. 
Before I close, I want to call out our marketing team, who continues to highlight the magic of Google to people around the world and the fourth annual Google Science Fair to Doodle for Google in the United States, the hugely popular ad campaigns. They've also helped to build great regional experience for Chromecast in over 6,000 stores. I'd like to thank all Googlers around the world who helped make this a terrific quarter. 
I'll, now, hand over back to Patrick.

Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ben Schachter, Macquarie. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ben Schachter,  Macquarie Research Equities - Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Patrick, I was wondering if you could help us quantify some of the expenses you saw, the one-time nature of G&A and anything else there that was really one time just to help us understand what that run rate would look like if that wasn't in there. 
Then, Nikesh, if you could talk about the theme of advertising attribution and how that's going to help you potentially bring over more brand dollars. How do you think about bringing over those television dollars? 
Is that something that's going to come sort of a big rush in 2014, or is this going to be a slow evolution over many years? Thanks. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Great, thanks, Ben. Why don't I start? 
Look, on the discrete legal expense that impacted, it really impacted our G&A. Then the one-time M&A deal costs impacted all of our operating lines, but most prominently our R&D line, which you'll notice will have jumped a bit. 
The one-time M&A deal costs are largely stemming from the Nest deal, which was a pretty large transaction for us this quarter. I think that the best way to describe it is that our expenses in Q1, they're completely in line with our objectives if you take apart these two items. So that's how I would describe it. Nikesh? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nikesh Arora,  Google Inc - SVP & Chief Business Officer    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thank you, Patrick. 
Thank you, Ben. 
The brand question is a very good question. What we've noticed in the past, let's just say year, year and a half, is that people have slowly started coming to the digital medium to create extension of their existing brand campaigns. 
Like I mentioned the Super Bowl ad. People come to YouTube and say -- I'd like to reach certain audiences which are only available on digital medium. Hence, we see those advertising dollars shifting as in enhancing existing television or media campaigns. 
The real fun will begin when people start doing campaigns exclusively in digital to go out and help them build brands. That requires us to get ahead of the curve and get into the creative process much earlier, because usually what we end up doing now is we get to the end of the creative process and they just want to extend their brand. 
So we're working really hard to work with the creative ad agencies or the large agency groups as well as our advertisers to say, how can we get ahead of that creative process? How can we help you conceive of brand campaigns that actually start and end in digital, where perhaps you use TV as an extension medium as opposed to the other way around? 
I think this is definitely the Holy Grail. This is going to take us a little bit of time to get there. 
But with things like attribution in place with our deals with Nielsen and comScore, we are beginning to create the comparability saying, look the same dollar you spend on television equates to so many dollars on digital or vice versa. 
The fact that we can give them cross-media measurement capability, we can give them comfort that their dollars are being well spent, even better spent on digital. It will go a long way in making sure that we get them to transition from just using traditional media to including digital in their media mix and eventually designing campaigns that start and end in digital.

    Thank you, Nikesh. 
Jamie, let's go to our next question. 
Thank you, Ben, for your question.

    Douglas Anmuth, JPMorgan.

Douglas Anmuth,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Two things I wanted to ask. 
First, Patrick, just on the US, you had commented on the strength here in terms of 14% year over year. But it does look like on a sequential basis, we saw a little bit more of a decel than in recent 1Qs. Could you just comment if there's any factors there to point out? 
Nikesh, can you just talk about the key drivers of mobile pricing going forward? How you think the gap can close with desktop over the coming quarters and years? Thanks. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    All right, thank you, Doug, for your questions. 
In the case of the US, if you think about it, we have the Q4 to Q1 issues that are typical. Then, as we've said before, the Network business does skew toward the US on a relative basis; so Network clearly grew slower than Site. So that's really what you see is that mix of the two. 
But in aggregate, pretty pleased with the US growth overall. So that was a pretty strong quarter, really happy with it. 
I'll let Nikesh answer the mobile question. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nikesh Arora,  Google Inc - SVP & Chief Business Officer    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Doug, thank you again for the question. 
I have had a firm belief, and I continue to hold on to it, that I believe in the medium to long term, mobile pricing has to be better than desktop pricing. The way to think about it is that in mobile you have location and you have context of individuals, which you don't have in the desktop. 
The more you know about the user and their context, the more effective advertising can provide them, the better the conversion is likely to be for a search or any piece of advertising that you do. There's a whole bunch of building blocks that need to come into play for us, like you said, to get the gap to close. 
The good news is a lot of people are spending a lot of time on mobile devices. There's a lot of mobile search queries we get. 
People are more and more focused about what to look for on mobile devices. They are closer to intent; they are closer to transaction. 
You see that there are a lot of frictionless ways of paying and converting transactions into commerce, which is happening with things like Instant Buy, etc. 
You're also seeing that a lot of the advertisers are seeing the true value of making sure that they're present in a great experience on the mobile device. So part of our challenge has been that maybe you have had this huge mass of advertisers in the desktop, which over the last decade have become better at advertising, understanding optimization, understanding conversion, understanding transaction. 
That journey is just beginning for advertisers on the mobile side. They're just beginning to understand what it takes for the end user to come transact on the website. 
So like right now, we can lead the horse to the water; we can't make it drink. But, with all of the advertisers coming on board and working with us, we are actually beginning to show them real transactions. As that begins to gain traction, I think we begin to see that gap continue to converge.

    Thank you. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thanks, Doug, for your question. 
Jamie, let's go to the next question. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Ross Sandler, Deutsche Bank. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ross Sandler,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I had a question on the Google Play app store revenues. 
Nikesh, you just mentioned that you guys paid out 300% more revenue to developers in 2013 versus 2012. How much is Play contributing to the overall licensing another line? 
There's clearly some lines, or some items in that line, that are not growing nearly as fast to get to the current 48% average. So, can you talk about maybe what's underperforming in that area? 
Then last question on this topic is, I think if you go back to the infamous Andy Rubin slides from the Oracle case, the rev share was around 5% for Google Play app store rev share. Where is that now, and is it changing as the Android ecosystem gets larger? Thanks. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Why don't I take a shot at this? 
Ross, if you think of our other revenue estimates for this quarter, first of all, we're really delighted by the Play business. You'll remember that a year ago we had --  I'm going to bring back everybody to Q1 of 2013. We have a lot of Nexus 4 hardware sales because we were in stock out in Q4. 
That, in combination with the accounting change of our Play app content revenue recognition, again remember to Q1 of last year, both just simply created a bit of a tougher year-over-year comp from this quarter. Overall, very pleased with all of the big lines of growth in this space. 
As per the rev share, I mean, obviously, this accounting change kind of goes to 30% rather than what you would have seen before, which would have been the net. But we don't divulge what the percentages are that we keep going forward. That's basically where we stand on it, and that's why we're pretty pleased with this line for this quarter. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nikesh Arora,  Google Inc - SVP & Chief Business Officer    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    If I could add to Patrick, I think the important part is it's taken us awhile to get all the capabilities in place around the world in different markets, making sure we have all the content we need, we have all the app providers we need, as well as we have the payment mechanisms. So we really are excited about the Google Play business going forward. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ross Sandler,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Great. Thanks, guys. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thanks, Ross. 
Jamie, let's go to our next question. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Mark May, Citi. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark May,  Citi - Analyst    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Question regarding the CPC segmentation for next quarter. 
While you might not be in a position to provide the specific datas points for Q1, I was hoping that maybe you could give us directionally how CPCs have trended between the owned and network businesses and what your expectation is going forward. Thanks. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Mark, you'll get the information in Q2. 
What we really wanted to do was a recognition, as we think about giving more transparency to our shareholders, just looking at having, exactly as you just mentioned, the split between our core Sites and then the Network itself. 
I think it will be useful for everybody. Then, obviously, we'll have the information going forward, so a lot of insight is going to come out of that. We're very pleased to be able to share it with you starting next quarter. 
We've just made this decision over the last little while and shared it with the committee of the Board, so just stay tuned for next quarter on it. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark May,  Citi - Analyst    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    There are a number of dynamics that play into the blended CPC that you've called out before: property, policy, geo and device, among others. Once you provide this new layer of transparency, does that really capture the major -- is it really the property and maybe to some degree policy differences that are influencing CPCs between owned and network,? 
Or will geo and devises continue to play a major role in the reported CPC, even once you provide this extra segmentation? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well, they all will. And if we do make changes to policies that affect Network, you'll see that in a much more transparent way. So in that sense, it's a very positive kind of news. 
Whether devises have effects on Network versus others, it will be much more difficult to see. Clearly, the impacts that are driven specifically for Network or for Sites, you'll be able to see on a quarter-by-quarter basis. I think that's good news for our investors. 
Thank you, so much for your question, Mark. 
Jamie, why do we go to our next question, please?

    Mark Mahaney, RBC Capital Markets.

Mark Mahaney,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Two questions. On the UK revenue growth, that 11% number, and the partner websites that 4%, is there anything you'd want to call out as being unusual drags on those growth rates? 
I think that UK is the lowest we've seen, and maybe that's just a lot of large numbers and really successful execution in that market. But anything you'd want to call out for either of those two revenue streams? Thanks. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As I said -- well, let me start with the UK. 
The UK, look, combination of partner mix this quarter as well as, again, year over year matters a lot. And we happen to have, a year ago, a real revenue favorable weather. People tend to forget it, but last year we had a very strong Q1 for the UK. The combination of these two things, just year over year, made the comparison a little tighter for this quarter. 
As it relates to websites, partner websites, I covered that a bit earlier. Again, you go back to last year where Network, if you think of Ad Exchange and AdMob continues to be very, very strong. 
You will remember, again last year, that we started the DLA policy change in Q1 -- or maybe it was in Q4. But the impact of the DLA actually takes time to flow through. 
We said that it would take multi quarters. So this has not flowed over completely; so what you have, again, there is very strong on the course where we want -- so the Ad Exchange and the AdMob, 
But on the flip side of that, you still have the tails of the DLA change policy that's from a year ago. But the effects have not fully flowed through; so even in the coming quarters, you should see a bit of an effect there. 
But overall, pretty pleased with, actually, these results, Mark.

Carlos Kirjner,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc.  - Analyst    [29]

    I have two questions. 
First, in the last eight quarters, headcount had grown significantly slower than revenue. But this quarter you hired, I think, 2,300 people in the quarter; and headcount grew with revenues. Was this change in hiring rate mostly because of acquisitions? And marginally, what prevents you from hiring 2,300 people a quarter or even more as the business grows? 
Secondly, Patrick, in the spirit of giving more transparency to shareholders, can you give us some color on what has driven such a sustained increase on CapEx over the last four quarters? Because I think clearly it's not just some lumpy behavior. 
Are you buying data center sites in advance of demand? And if this is the case, can we infer that CapEx will revert to historical levels? Thank you. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thank you, Carlos, for both of these questions. 
To the headcount question, I think you've basically nailed it intuitively, which is the acquisition of Nest. The acquisitions this quarter had quite a bit of people impact on this number. 
If you think of our organic numbers, have actually not changed in any material way. So it just happened; you buy Nest and it comes with a lot of people. 
We also had, you'll remember, the acquisition of DeepMind and a few others. So for us, we had the double hitter of having the opportunity to continue to attract people on an organic basis through our processes and these few acquisitions moved the needle quite a bit for us this quarter. 
As it relates to CapEx, listen, you're right that we -- and I've mentioned this in the last couple of quarters and just a reminder to everybody -- if you think of the CapEx categories, data center is first and data center construction; then production equipment; then all other facilities. It's like the hierarchy of needs. 
In the case of data center construction, we have found that the option value of having more capacity on stand by and available to us to grow versus not having it, is actually a real strategic issue for the Company. 
In that sense, if for whatever reason we continue -- we had a spike in demand that was really pronounced and sustained for a couple quarters, and we did not have the capacity -- it would be a real issue strategically for us relative to the quite low cost of having the infrastructure in place. 
That's why we're really pushing ahead of the curve and so it's with this view of long term. From that perspective you're also right that that's the mind set we're applying. 
We've always said that CapEx was lumpy. So you have a good manifestation of it right now, right here. 
Thank you for those two questions, Carlos.

    Nikesh, in order to attract greater brand advertising dollars, it seems like safety and context are also important factors because you're certainly not falling short on reach. How close do you think you are to either engineering or coming up with some sort of a solution to contextualize all the video content on YouTube so you can guarantee your advertisers brand safety? Thanks. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nikesh Arora,  Google Inc - SVP & Chief Business Officer    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    That's a good question. 
I think, as I alluded to, we are going to do an upfront in a few weeks in New York City called Google Preferred, which is our way of trying to create a premium concentration of content that we can have advertisers advertise against, which gives them a higher level of brand safety, a better level of measurement and hopefully, a place where they believe that they can actually build a brand. 
Hopefully, that will manifest itself and our ability to have a premium compared to what we can attract in the market without providing those kinds of things. So that's a very good question. That's what we're hoping to achieve, and stay tuned for our detailed announcement of BrandCast.

    I have three quick things. 
Did Enhanced Campaigns, which you rolled out over the summer, impact Q4? Do you see some more benefits coming this year? 
Second, on PLAs, we think you had very good success in the US in Q4. Did that -- do you still have some benefits to come from that as you roll that out in Europe? How are you looking at the timing there versus how you rolled it out in the US? 
Finally, in the first quarter, maybe you could call out specific verticals that might have been strong or weak for you. Thank you. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nikesh Arora,  Google Inc - SVP & Chief Business Officer    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    That's a good question, Justin, thank you. 
I'm not sure I can give you a lot of detail in terms of precise impacts of any individual products that we have; but Enhanced Campaigns are working. 
It was a necessity that we had to do them, both for process reasons as well as the reason that consumers are going from screen to screen, as well as advertisers need to advertise across multiple screens. From that perspective, Enhanced Campaigns is working. It's part of life here. We don't do anything without Enhanced Campaigns, across the board. 
It's gone from Enhanced Campaigns to regular campaigns because we don't have any unenhanced campaigns anymore. 
In terms of PLAs, it's something, as I alluded, was actually working. It's providing a lot of color in the shopping vertical; it's providing a lot of the whole new Shopping campaign effort that we have. 
PLA is working for us, and it's working from multiple perspectives. It is providing users the detailed information that they need when they are declaring intent and saying -- I'd like to search for a particular product. Please don't send me to a website. 
So it is working. We are going to roll that out once every time around the world. I cannot comment on the timing exactly, but I think both of those things are having a positive impact in our minds to everything we're doing around here. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Just to close on this, just a few verticals here, again completely reflecting the economy around us. 
If you go to -- automobile has been quite strong across the world. Travel actually quite strong in the UK as well as in the rest of the world, a little bit less in the US. But just to give you a sense of, and then real estate, clearly in the US has been a strong vertical as well as in the UK. 
Again, a good reflection of the economy there, Justin. 
Google Trends, I always encourage people to go and check out Google Trends as well because they continue to give good insights as to what's going on in the economy, which we mirror in terms of verticals.

Eric Sheridan,  UBS - Analyst    [45]

    So, two ones. 
One for Nikesh. Nikesh, would love to get your view of the travel industry. How you are approaching that industry as a participant from an economic basis, not industry, both the marketing funnel and potentially the booking funnel longer term? There's been a lot written lately about the way in which you guys might approach that industry vertical. 
Second, Patrick, for you, maybe taking a stab at the one-time expenses from a different approach. When we look at the model, if we take your comments before about smoothing out the expenses we saw in the back part of the year and even year on year, it appears the one-time expenses might have been about a 50 to 100 basis point impact on each of those two lines, which would have brought the blended number back up to somewhere between 75 to 150 basis points on margins. 
Just wanted to take a stab at that from a different direction just to quantify it. Thanks, guys. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nikesh Arora,  Google Inc - SVP & Chief Business Officer    [46]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thanks, Eric, for the question. 
I was actually, while you were talking, I was pulling up the article which recently aired. Darren Houston talked about the effectiveness of Google advertising for Priceline. I think that's a public endorsement that all our efforts in the last many years around the travel industry are actually working. 
They see tremendous value in our ability to help them bring more travelers to their sites and for them to help convert them into real transactions. Whatever we're doing is working. 
I am suspecting that the comments you're talking about are our continued efforts in providing more and more detailed information when people do searches. 
We've talked in the past before that people's information needs are getting more and more precise, and we have to keep evolving the results at Google, whether it's Knowledge cards or Google Now. All the things we do towards giving them more and more precise answers, in which case sometimes we are required to go work with various industries to get the underlying data to surface it when the users are looking as opposed to send them to other sites, where they have to go through that search process again. 
I think you can expect us to continue to do that, but our intent there is to provide a better answer for the users whether it's on their desktop or mobile devices. Accordingly, we also work together with the advertisers to provide them various advertising opportunities, which allow them to work effectively with the end user and provide them the answer that they're looking for or perhaps, in this case, the ticket or the hotel booking that they're looking for. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Great. And on my side, Eric, as I said in my earlier comments, our Q1 expenses were completely in line with our objectives. There's always seasonality, as you've noticed. From Q4 to Q1, we spend less on marketing; so that's true for this year as well. 
For the other areas, we would have been in line with the objectives we'd set for ourselves. These one-time costs were genuinely, in that spirit, truly one time. 
I mean, when you acquire Nest for a bit over $3 billion, there's just a lot of stuff that flows through the P&L, a lot of accounting. That's really the issue there. So I would go back to your instinct of, at least we should be roughly in line with our expectations were. That's why the nature of truly extraordinary items. 
Thanks for that question.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter Stabler,  Wells Fargo Securities - Analyst    [51]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Wanted to revisit attribution for a moment. 
There are different aspects to attribution. I think you guys are doing a great job on the cross-screen attribution and taking advantage of your ubiquitous logins across different platforms in Enhanced Campaigns. 
Wanted to get a better understanding of how you're thinking about online versus offline attribution for those types of marketers, particularly brand advertisers, supermarket advertisers, the 30,000 SKUs in those retail channels that don't have eCommerce and really don't have much of a search opportunity. 
How are you helping them close the gap between their online activity and offline sales? Thanks very much. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nikesh Arora,  Google Inc - SVP & Chief Business Officer    [52]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thanks, Peter. Thanks again for the question. 
I think, as you rightfully pointed out, the attribution story on the advertising side is becoming clearer as we partner with Nielsen and comScore have adopted some of the mechanisms that traditional media has used to create the comparability between traditional and new media. 
I think you identify a good challenge, which is how do we bridge the gap between online commerce and offline commerce and relate that to the advertising opportunity? I.e. when we sell search or we sell traffic to different people, how do we convince them? How do we make them realize that that traffic that they bought not only results in online sales but also results in offline sales in stores? And how do we encourage that activity? 
Over the past many years, around the world, we have run specific studies working with various advertisers, which I call online-to-store studies, where we actually try and measure what online activity created by them through control groups results in more foot traffic in their particular stores in certain regions at our end. 
We pretty much have very good results across-the-board. I can't detail specifics right now because they are all specific to individual advertisers who we work with. But we do understand that opportunity and the problem. And we work specifically with third-party research teams to work on figuring out how do we keep showing the online-to-store efficacy? 
There are other products, as you can see, where we start doing conversion. We start looking at things like Google Shopping, especially, which also helps in those areas. Thanks, again.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Heather Bellini, Goldman Sachs. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Heather Bellini,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [56]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I just wanted to go back to an earlier question. 
There was a -- you responded about the building blocks that were needed in order to get mobile pricing, mobile CPCs to converge with desktop. I was just wondering if you could share with us, specifically, what you think those building blocks are that need to happen over the medium to long term, as you said, to see that convergence occur? Thank you. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nikesh Arora,  Google Inc - SVP & Chief Business Officer    [57]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Of course, thanks, Heather, for the question. 
Look, there are some very simple things; and there are some complicated things. The simple things are, we need to make sure that there is payment enablement for users. So, i.e., users have a mechanism that allows them to pay with the lowest amount of friction. 
Because honestly, you and I don't want to spend our lives trying to enter payment information on a very small screen where we're trying to conduct a transaction. That enablement is happening across the industry, across multiple payment platforms. 
There's also the need that when people search for some things they can get quickly down to the information and they don't have to browse multiple sites, because people are more keen on declaring intent on mobile devices then going and surfing multiple websites and trying to figure out what they are trying to do. 
That intent could be in the form of restaurant. It could be in the form of a taxi, could be in the form of them looking for individual product. You're beginning to see apps. You're beginning to see solutions in search that allow you to get to that granularity of information. 
Now, of course, there's a big building block, which is getting all the people out there, which are the advertisers, effectively in this case the merchants, who actually have to have experiences in mobile side, which are simpler to execute on. 
Try buying something on many companies' mobile websites, and it's more onerous than their desktop sites because they've been spending a decade trying to optimize the desktop site, when they haven't spent enough time optimizing their mobile experience. In some cases, not believing that people want to transact with them on their mobile device. In some cases, they are just slow; and they are just slowly diverting resources from the desktop to mobile. 
If you take all those things, and if you take the notion that we need to keep working hard towards getting these building blocks in place, I think there is a finite time where these building blocks will come into place. And as they keep coming into place, you will see, or as we talked about earlier, perhaps the convergence will happen between pricing and mobile and desktop. 
But there's a whole bunch of other issues that go into it. Those are the big things I can think of, right now.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colin Sebastian,  Robert W. Baird & Company - Analyst    [61]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I wanted to ask you a question on the Cloud platform since this is, obviously, a huge revenue opportunity for you. First off, if you could put some context around the impact of this business on CapEx and OpEx, particularly on the infrastructure of the service part of the business. 
Secondly, if you could talk about how you're planning to differentiate this service? Is it really about pricing, or is it by tying in the software and platform as a service offering -- if you could touch on that. Thanks very much. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [62]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I can cover the first part, and then I'll let Nikesh cover the second. 
We're very comfortable with our cost structure in light of Google efficiencies, economies of scale, our vertical integration from data center to chip to servers to software. I mean, we believe we have an absolute unique position from a cost structure perspective. Therefore, from a margin perspective makes us very, very comfortable. In terms of differentiation, I'll just let Nikesh jump in here. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nikesh Arora,  Google Inc - SVP & Chief Business Officer    [63]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thank you, again, for the question. 
The important part to at least acknowledge in the space of cloud computing is we think it's very, very early days. If you think about the potential scope and scale of what this opportunity is, that pretty much every business which is going to be around for the long term has to operate in the cloud. 
There's no efficiency compared to the efficiency of the cloud, compared to owning your own infrastructure and running it by yourself. So this shift is going to happen. It's a matter of every company going through that shift one at a time. 
If you look at the opportunities out there and the options, there are very few options. There's a lot of room for all of us to have a great time for many, many years before we start worrying about differentiation and why my thing is better than yours. 
Right now, the key is to be able to work with the companies out there, the enterprise customers out there, to get them to shift of their legacy systems, get on to the cloud, and realize that Google has been working in the cloud for more than a decade because we have been running one of the largest cloud computing platforms in the world and in the public space. 
We have all the expertise and the skills that are required to be able to serve these enterprises and get them off their current legacy systems onto the cloud. Our effort is really trying to work with each of these with third-party partners trying to get them off their legacy systems onto our Cloud. 
I don't think the challenge right now is the need to differentiate. I think our biggest differentiator is we have the most experience in the space.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Jordan Monahan, Morgan Stanley. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jordan Monahan,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [67]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Actually, two if I may. 
A couple of big picture questions, I think for Nikesh. The first is that I think there's an ongoing debate about whether mobile web or mobile app is going to win and what the implications are for various businesses, Google included. I'm just curious to get your view on whether you think one will win over the other and then whether it matters for Google. 
The second is, when you look at Google's share of global advertising, you're coming up on about 10% of total. But when you look at your business in the UK, you're north of 20% of total. When you think about your global businesses as economies start to mature, do you think the UK is a fair proxy for thinking about your business globally? Or are there other factors that you think may prevent you from getting to that type of scale globally? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nikesh Arora,  Google Inc - SVP & Chief Business Officer    [68]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Let me answer the second question first, Jordan, because I'm standing here. Patrick is looking at me asking the same question. 
The way to think about it is that we have 10%, by some metric, depending on what we believe the total is. As per your metric, we have 10% of the total advertising money; and in the UK, we have 20%. That just tells me there's 90% more opportunity around the world and 80% more opportunity in the UK. 
We're not going to constrain our thinking in terms of what believe is a stable state. Our aspiration is to be able to serve every advertiser in the long term, and our hope is that every piece of advertising becomes digital advertising. The question is how much of that are we able to provide through our technology platforms? How much are we able to provide through our own properties and how much do we partner with others to provide on their network? 
I guess I'm trying to tell you that we don't constrain ourselves in our thinking. I'm not trying to be arrogant and say we want 100%, but we'd like more than what we have in every market out there. 
In terms of your question around the mobile web and mobile search, that is a tough question. That is very involved question, and I think the approach, the best way to think about it is that we're trying to make sure that we can make both of them effective for the end user and make them both work because we're not about to try and pick winners. 
Right now, you can see that people spend as much time on mobile devices and more time on mobile devices than they have been able to spend on the desktop. And, they're spending their time across the mobile web, as well as the mobile app landscape. 
We are participating in both those ecosystems, whether it's through or Play Store or the App front, whether it's through our browser-based search properties or through our app-based search properties. We're participating across the board. I think at the end of the day, it's going to boil down to ease of use and consumer choice.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Robert Peck, SunTrust. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert Peck,  SunTrust Robinson Humphrey - Analyst    [72]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Two questions, if you don't mind. 
The first one is on the revenue side. Can you talk a little bit, maybe give us an update about the break out of YouTube verses DoubleClick revenues? Where are those today, and where could they be over time? 
Then, on the cost side, Patrick, could you just walk us through just how do you think about the ROI on capital? We get a lot of questions from investors asking about spending it. Could you maybe tell us more about the thought process of how the Company looks at the ROIC of capital going forward? Thank you. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [73]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. Well, Robert, let's start with the last one first; and then we'll go back to revenue. 
ROI, clearly, we always look at capital intensity. The fact that we're investing quite a bit in CapEx right now is a real tribute to the potential and the optimism we have about our businesses going forward. 
Most of our core businesses, if you think of YouTube or advertising or Search, are not that capital intensive relative to other areas that we have such as for example, Google Fiber, if you think of the access portion, which is much more traditional CapEx. 
For each of these areas, we actually track and make sure that we have good returns and we have a capital efficient. So, even though an area that -- take the advertising business that we run -- even though you could argue that it's phenomenally good on return on capital, the questions that we will ask internally is -- Okay, so if the utilization rate is X on our machines on this business, why can't it be X plus something? 
So even though we have already good return on capital in these areas, we continue to always push the envelope to make sure that our capital efficiency continues to be better and better on a year-to-year basis. Then across a portfolio, every area has some capital targets to make sure that we are driving for value. 
Finally, there are a number of areas, if you think of -- take the newer stuff, like Loon, for example. In those cases, you test through the hurdles that we seed capital to the Loon team as they hit their hurdles and they earned their right to the next cost for funding. In doing so, we continue to always have the business case in mind that says here is why this continues to make sense to fund and invest. 
With an ROIC or value in mind for the long term, but in the short term it's really delivery of milestones on very specific engineering objectives that actually gives them the next round of funding. 
Robert, as you can see, given the portfolio of mature stuff we have and growing areas, as well as much more R&D and innovation at the early stages, we just need to have a basket of tools to actually manage the concept of ROIC or ROI on each of them. 
That's what we do. It's not rocket science. It just requires a lot of discipline on our part. 
On the revenue side, we don't break out DoubleClick or YouTube. I can just tell you, as I had mentioned a bit earlier, we're really pleased with our Network revenue in the AdMob, Ad Exchange. 
Many of our areas continue to grow very well; and we're very, very pleased by these investments and, clearly, continue to be very pleased with YouTube, as Nikesh mentioned a bit earlier.

    Another question regarding trends in mobile CPCs. 
I know yesterday you announced an offline conversion tracking plan and program with Datalogic. Is that something, potentially, the whole online/offline tracking that could have a positive impact on CPCs and, separately, any updates on how you think about fiber longer term? Thanks. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Pichette,  Google Inc - SVP & CFO    [78]

    Okay, so why don't I take the last portion; and then Nikesh may have views on this data conversion plan. 
On Fiber, you've heard our announcement earlier this quarter, where we're working with 34 cities and looking for working with these municipalities, where they've indicated to us they are really excited about. They kind of self-selected to be really excited about getting fiber and the next generation of access. 
So right now, we're basically working directly with them to look if we have the right conditions to actually go to the next stage, which would be the build. So very excited about it. I think that it's a really good sign of things to come in access in general. I think that everybody now in the industry is talking about the gig. It's becoming the standard. 
We're absolutely thrilled for all of the users out there that can think that they'll one day get a gigabit of symmetrical Internet at reasonable price. So stay tuned on the next part of the chapter, but really excited to work with these communities. 
Nikesh, maybe you want to talk about --?

    Yes, thank you, Gene. 
As I mentioned earlier, and the question earlier from I think it was Heather, that the online-to-offline conversions are a really important opportunity where it's important for offline merchants to be able to understand what results they get from their online activity. Some of the experiments that we talked about required partnerships with third-party data providers to understand how that happens. 
I think Datalogic is one of those things which we are looking to see how we can help quantify the opportunity and quantify the answer for our offline partners. It's just one of those things that we're doing.

    Just in closing before I hand it over to Jamie, just to reiterate the point that Nikesh made a bit earlier, to all of our Googlers out there and all of our partners out there, thank you so much for the great work in Q1. What a great start to the year. Then, we'll see you in Q2. Thanks a million. 
Jamie, I'll leave it with you to close the call, please.
